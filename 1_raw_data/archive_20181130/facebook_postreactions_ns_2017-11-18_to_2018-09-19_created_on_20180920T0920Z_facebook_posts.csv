Results are in from the booze bus, which saw two drivers having their vehicles impounded after being detected well and truly over the legal limit.  A 42-year-old Mordialloc man blew .113% and a man from Avenel, aged in his late 20's gave a breath test result of .124%.  They have both said goodbye to their cars for a month and will be facing court.

They advised her that her computer needed fixing after being hacked and to do so, they needed $600 worth of iTunes cards as payment and access to her home computer. The victim purchased the iTunes cards and also provided bank account details.  The scammers then told her they‚Äôd ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô deposited money into her bank account and asked her to return $2000 to them and to not to discuss this with anyone.   The victim realised something was amiss and sought advice. She was able to get in touch with the real Telstra and make sure no software had been installed on her computer by the hackers. She also had to close her bank account to ensure it hadn‚Äôt been compromised.   Police encourage members of the community to be aware of scams such as this. Police also ask the public to warn members of their family that may not see warnings such as this online; especially the elderly in the community.  Police advise members of the public that;  - Unless a purchase is from an iTunes store, iBooks or Apple music store- there is NO reason you‚Äôd need to make a payment via iTunes Gift Cards.  - Beware of ‚Äòcold callers‚Äô especially if they ask for personal details.  - If you receive any phone calls about issues with your computer, seek independent advice from reputed computer repairers or from your internet/ phone provider.  - Don‚Äôt accept where someone is from simply because they tell you so over the phone.  - Calls can be easily diverted through local servers to appear that they have originated from Australia, even if the caller is overseas.  - If it sounds suspicious, it probably is. Make enquiries with the company directly, sourcing the phone numbers yourself and not relying on what the caller has told you over the phone. Scammers networks can be very well run and include numerous people in an attempt to appear authentic.  Apple provides the following information about scams linked to iTunes cards; https://support.apple.com/en-au/itunes-gift-card-scams  If you think you have been the victim of an scam such as this, please lodge a report with ACORN (Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network) at www.acorn.gov.au.",,18,16,24,

The launch was attended by the COGG, DOJR, Victoria Government and local retailers/traders.   Inspector Darlow stated ‚Äúthe establishment of the Traders Association will enable a direct communication link and support between Police and retailers to inform them of relevant issues and crime prevention initiatives to ensure the vibrant precinct remains safe and secure  It also provides operational police members contact details of a specific retailer after hours if operational necessity requires it‚Äù.    A Public Safety Infrastructure Grant of $10,000 has been approved to develop ‚ÄòTraders Kits‚Äô which will provide traders with information on how to make their business safe and secure in a dynamic and changing environment.     Leading Senior Constable King from the Crime Prevention Office officially launched the ‚ÄúNo Cash on Premises‚Äù initiative with the Pakington Street Traders Association which was first implemented into Bellarine (Ocean Grove Traders Association) in February 2016 with much success.  Inspector Darlow stated ‚Äúthe practise of daily takings and floats being left within retail premises overnight was seen as a major causation of offences in the Burglary offence category.  This strategy involves the education of correct money handling by retailers where by ""no cash is left on premises"" after hours and that the cash register draw is left open and money tray is visibly placed along with a sign indicating that there is no money left on the premises.  Since its inception into the Bellarine, there has been no commercial burglary targeting cash at retail outlets.  This will be one in a range of initiatives that will be introduced into the Pakington Street retail precinct and we look forward to working with the Pakington Street Traders Association and other partners to ensuring this remains an attractive, safe and vibrant location to visit‚Äù.",,11,1,6,

Reports to Scamwatch show there are three common scam examples the ACCC is currently seeing where scammers are demanding iTunes gift cards as payment:  Tax scams ‚Äì the scammer pretends to be from the Australian Taxation Office and claim there is a warrant out for their victim‚Äôs arrest. If the victim doesn‚Äôt pay an immediate ‚Äòfine‚Äô using iTunes gift cards, the scammer claims police will come and handcuff them.  Catch-a-hacker scam ‚Äì scammers pretending to be Telstra will ask their victim to help them catch a ‚Äòhacker‚Äô who‚Äôs trying to get into their PC or smart devices. They‚Äôll use this sham story to get the victim to buy iTunes cards as a ‚Äòtrap‚Äô for catching the hacker. Unfortunately the scammer will quickly get the serial numbers for those gift cards and sell them before the victim realises they‚Äôve been duped.  Centrelink scams ‚Äì the scammer pretends to be from Centrelink and tells their victim they‚Äôre entitled to an additional payment, such as for their pension, and that they need to pay a ‚Äòrelease fee‚Äô in iTunes gift cards to receive the payment.

I‚Äôm pleased to tell you the latest figures show the crime rate in Cardinia has decreased by 16.9%, thanks to significant decreases in high-volume crimes such as burglaries, thefts and robberies.   While it‚Äôs pleasing to see a drop in these crime categories, rest assured we are not complacent. Police across Cardinia will continue to work hard to prevent, deter, investigate and arrest offenders in order to keep people and their property safe.   We have and will continue to maintain a strong focus on crime categories that significantly impact community safety such as assault and related offences (down 10%), burglary/break and enter (down 16.9%), robbery (down 30.3%), theft (down 18.6%).   Some categories of crime have increased, including cultivate or manufacture drugs (up 31.3%) and weapons-related offences (up 23.9%), which is primarily due to police activity and enforcement as we continue to arrest and charge offenders for these types of offences.   I‚Äôd like to thank the community for your ongoing support and remind everyone that prevention is the key. Lock your vehicle when unattended and don‚Äôt leave valuable items visible to passers-by. This type of theft is mostly opportunistic so can be prevented by simple security measures.   If you see something suspicious, say something. If the matter is urgent call 000 or report to Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.

The Enhancing Police Responses to Family Violence project is a joint initiative between Victoria Police, Forensicare, Medicare Local and Swinburne University established in late 2014 to improve family violence risk assessment and management.   Part of the project has involved working with Swinburne to redevelop the family violence risk assessment tool to create a new actuarial risk assessment instrument, the VP-SAFvR, to be piloted in the Police Service Areas of Maribyrnong, Hobson‚Äôs Bay and Wyndham.   The new tool is having a significant impact on the response, risk assessment and management of family violence incidents in the pilot area since being introduced in June 2016.   Crime statistics agency data shows a 10% reduction in family violence-related serious assaults, a 14% reduction in repeat affected family members and a 16% reduction in repeat respondents.

Whether you are attending the office Christmas party, or simply celebrating the season with loved ones, police are urging all road users to be responsible and safe.   Senior Sergeant Glenn Parker said catastrophic consequences were never far away whenever people engaged in unsafe behaviour on the road.   ‚ÄúWe know there is an increased risk taking on our roads around licensed premises in Whittlesea this time of year,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúAs such, we will deploy marked and unmarked police cars across the area in an effort to minimise road trauma.    ‚ÄúThe hope is that the only thing our police will see is safe, responsible behaviour.‚Äù   Police will target the main causes of fatalities and serious injuries including excessive speed, mobile phone use and driver distraction, seatbelts, fatigue and drink and drug drivers.   Across Victoria over the past five years, 59 people have been killed and over 1500 people seriously injured on the roads during the Christmas and New Year period.   ‚ÄúKeep any eye on your friends and loved ones to ensure they are primarily thinking of safety whenever they use our roads,‚Äù Snr Sgt Parker said.   ‚ÄúEven a momentary lapse in judgment can result in an empty seat at the Christmas table next week.‚Äù",,36,9,25,

We‚Äôve had some great results over the last 12 months with substantial reductions across crime against the person and crime against property categories.  Throughout 2017 we have increased the number of police members working nightshifts to ensure an enhanced response to emerging crime trends, and we‚Äôve undertaken a significant number of local crime and road policing operations.  We won‚Äôt be resting over the holidays ‚Äì more operations are scheduled for next year, including plain clothed operations targeting public transport and retail precincts, and throughout the holiday period we will be highly visible with random preliminary breath testing sites throughout the Knox response zone ‚ÄìBayswater, Boronia, Ferntree Gully, Knox, Lysterfield, Rowville, Scoresby, The Basin, Upper Ferntree Gully, Wantirna & Wantirna South.   As the summer season progresses, so too does our emergency management preparedness.  Wherever you may be enjoying a well-deserved Xmas break, please remember on days of high fire risk, it is better to leave early and go to a safe place, than to leave exit plans until the last minute.  If you are going away for the holidays, make sure that your home is locked, that you‚Äôve told someone where you are going, usually a friend, neighbour, or relative, so they can maintain some security on your residence whilst you are away. Theft from motor car remains an ongoing issue in our area ‚Äì please ensure you remove all valuables and secure your car in a garage if possible. If you are going away and leaving your car at home, please ensure it is locked and that your keys are hidden.

The vehicle, nicknamed the ‚ÄúGuardian‚Äù, apart from being a fully operational Highway Patrol vehicle is a rolling example of some of the most advanced safety features that have ever been fitted to a road going vehicle.   Two years ago, Victoria Police formed a partnership with Mercedes Benz to promote the future of vehicle safety. If every vehicle in Australia was fitted with the technology found in this vehicle road trauma could be reduced by a third overnight. To achieve this in the future, we need to change the way industry and households purchase a vehicle and start making safety a standard feature, not an optional extra.  Mercedes Benz has loaned the vehicle to Victoria Police to promote the new technologies and help us drive down road trauma across our state.   The Guardian has already been put to use and is already on patrol.  The vehicle will be on patrol over the Christmas and New Year periods in the Geelong, Bellarine, Surfcoast and Colac areas conducting traffic patrols and assisting with significant traffic operations.  Geelong Highway Patrol urge you to take care this holiday period.  Don‚Äôt drive impaired by alcohol, drugs or lack of sleep, make sure you and all your vehicle occupants wear a suitable seatbelt or restraint, observe the posted limits and avoid distraction by putting that phone or electronic device away and out of sight.   247 people have lost their lives on Victoria‚Äôs roads so far this year.

Greensborough Highway Patrol and our State Highway Patrol Units will be working right through this holiday period targeting the fatal four contributing factors to collisions speed, drug/drink driving, fatigue and seat belts.    Speed is a proven to increase your chances of having a collision.  Better to be late than not getting there at all.    Drink/Drug driving is a major contributory factor to road crashes and road deaths.   If you going to a party and plan to indulge in a drink or two don‚Äôt drive. Stay the night or plan a safe alternative to get home such as a cab or designated driver who does not drink.  Don‚Äôt  forget that even in the morning after you have slept you could still be over the limit.  The same applies to drugs.  Wearing your seat belt reduces your risk of dying or being seriously injured in a collision so always buckle up. Also, make sure young passengers are buckled into appropriate safety seats. Fatigue is the hidden killer.  Please don‚Äôt try to drive if  you feel your eyes shutting.  A microsleep could kill you or others.   Take turns driving if there is another licensed person in the vehicle.  Take regular breaks if you are on a long journey.  Motorcyclists should ride wearing protective clothing.  Be aware of debris on the road and soft shoulders on rural highays.  Ride within the limits of your ability. If your towing a caravan or trailer ensure it is correctly coupled to your vehicle and that any load is secured correctly by an appropriate method of restraint.  Make sure that your vehicle is mechanically safe and legally roadworthy.   Enjoy your holidays and please drive safely.",,7,1,1,

The project is referred to as the Westgate PACER (Police and Clinician Emergency Response) and involves a uniformed police member and qualified mental health clinician working together 7 days per week during the afternoon/evening.  The primary role of the PACER unit is to assist front line members attending tasks where people are exhibiting suicidal behaviour or suffering from some sort of mental health crisis.  This allows for the person in crisis to be given expert assistance and treatment, but also allows for the front line uniform members to be relieved to attend other tasks increasing community safety. The project is ongoing and has assisted in forming an extremely strong working relationship between the Health Services and Victoria Police, as well as assisting the community as a whole.

A. Parents and carers should be advised that children under 15 years of age are at the greatest risk of harm from drinking and that for this age group, not drinking alcohol is especially important. B. For young people aged 15‚àí17 years, the safest option is to delay the initiation of drinking for as long as possible. Put simply, it is best for young people aged under 18 years to avoid drinking alcohol. It is also important to understand that young adults aged up to 25 years are also still at greater risk of alcohol-related harms.

The accord is one avenue police use to help enforce liquor laws and reduce violence and other unacceptable behaviour.   Dandenong police Sergeant Pat Green has worked closely with licensees to drive an inclusive and robust Liquor Accord which is geared towards education and networking.    Sgt Green said while compliance was a responsibility of licensees, an effective relationship with police would reduce risk of offences occurring in the first place.      Greater Dandenong licensing Inspector Mark Langhorn said some of the benefits of being a Liquor Accord member include an agreement to a standard of responsible management for the licensed premises, community recognition for commitment and a clearly articulated link between the accord and overall community safety strategies.     ‚ÄúIt is vital to the success of a Liquor Accord that we have a good representative group to discuss issues that impact the liquor industry,‚Äù he said.    ‚ÄúI commend licensees to the Greater Dandenong Liquor Accord which will provide the platform to network with other key stakeholders.‚Äù    The next Liquor Accord meeting is set for 3pm on Tuesday, 6 March, 2018.

Thieves have targeted schools, community sporting clubs, residential and commercial properties.  The meters are stolen by thieves for their value as brass scrap metal and sold on the black market. Each meter is worth only between $15 and $40, but cost South East Water up to $1,000 for replacement. These thefts cause the residents huge inconvenience as often their property has the water shut off for days and they are not able to shower, use the toilet or cook. They are also required to foot the bill for the plumber to install the new meter. Commercial businesses can potentially suffer huge losses if machines are forced to shut down until water is reconnected and schools.  These meters are easily stolen by desperate thieves and only require unbolting with a shifter. The issue for the thieves is offloading them as reputable scrap metal dealers want touch accept them and provide details to police of anyone attempting to sell them to the police.   Police are urging residents to be vigilant and keep an eye out for any suspicious activity especially late at night or the early hours of the morning when most of the thefts are occurring.  Images and video  are attached of a thief who ripped off and stole a length of copper water pipe from St Francis Xavier Catholic Church on Davey Street Frankston, at 1 AM on 14/01/18.",,30,51,21,

After Tyabb won the toss and elected to bowl the Chief leading from the front faced the first delivery bowled by the local Federal Minster Greg Hunt.  The Chief lifted the first delivery over the cover fieldsman and it went for four.  Greg Hunt soon got his revenge having the Chief caught in the gully of his third delivery.    The police team went on to make 189 off its twenty overs.  What looked like a respectable total was chased down by the Tyabb team with just over an over to spare to give Tyabb a memorable win.  The match was played in excellent spirit and all funds raised donated to a very worthy cause.  Thanks to all those involved who made it such a successful event.

I started my police career in Wyndham as a brand new trainee five years ago. I've had the pleasure of working with the most dedicated, resilient police officers this state will likely see. I've met so many wonderful people of Wyndham, been afforded so many opportunities, learnt more than I ever thought possible and I'll admit, I've had some days I'd rather forget. However this picture comes from a shift I'll always hold dear: I had the pleasure of working one of my final shifts on the divvy van with my father, Superintendent Gillard (who hasn't worked a div van since police used typewriters... long before I was born.)  Being an admin of this page has been so enjoyable, and I thank each and every follower for their support, curiosity and engagement. Without the followers, there's no point in having the page. When you see your police officers out and about, please say hi. You're the reason they do what they do, and rest assured, whether you see it or not, they continually go above and beyond for the people of Wyndham.

This offending justifiably upset segments of our Kyabram community.  One of the lads was from Bendigo and had 10 other warrants outstanding plus the new charges for the offences that occurred in Kyabram over the previous week.   He was remanded into custody at Bendigo Police Station.  The other 14 year old was from Kyabram and he was charged for all the offences in Kyabram committed in the company or the Bendigo lad.  The Kyabram youth was presented before a bail justice and bailed into his mother care to appear Bendigo Magistrates' Court the following day.  He failed to appear and was arrested again that day and this time remanded into custody.  The Kyabram lad was originally arrested with the help of a local Kyabram man who observed the two youths rummaging through a vehicle.  The observant community member held the youth and called police.  The vehicles entered were all unlocked with money and other items on display.  These vehicles are considered soft targets.  This is another simple way the community can get involved by removing valuables from their parked cars and locking them.  The 14 year old Kyabram boy was supposed to reside with his mother however he was left largely unsupervised and required to fend for himself.  His offending was stealing cash and credit cards to buy food is linked to the absence of care from his guardian.  Police have since worked closely with DHHS to ensure this issue is addressed for the sake of the youth and also the community.  Local police encourage the local community to vigilant but not alarmed.  Look after your neighbours and if you see something suspicious please let us know.

Two drivers were taken to Frankston Hospital with minor injuries, whilst five vehicles were extensively damaged and one received minor damage.

When the lights turned green a blue Holden station wagon directly in front of them accelerated away to a detected speed of 131 km/h. The vehicle was intercepted, and the members spoke to the 31 y.o. female driver from Frankston South, who had an 8 y.o. girl in the front passenger seat.  The driver held a P2 probationary driver licence (0.00 alcohol limit) but wasn't carrying it with her, and there were no 'P' plates displayed on the car. She then underwent a preliminary breath test which detected alcohol, and a subsequent test showed an alleged reading of 0.054%. The driver stated that she had been drinking bourbon whilst driving, only moments prior to being intercepted.  The vehicle was then impounded for a minimum of 30 days with a release fee of $1042.40. Prior to the tow-truck arriving the driver wrote a note in the dust on the bonnet of the car, presumably for her partner who owns the car to read when he gets it out of the impound yard. (See circled)  The female will be receiving a summons to appear in Frankston Magistrates' Court for; Exceeding Speed Limit, Drink Driving, Consuming Intoxicating Liquor Whilst Driving, Failing to Carry Probationary Licence & Failing to Display 'P' Plates.   If you are speeding with alcohol/drugs in your system and have a collision which seriously injures or kills someone then you will possibly be facing a period of imprisonment, irrespective of your prior driving history. Please slow down and don't drink (or drug) drive.  (Author: VP30339)",,217,298,77,

Another crime trend is emerging.  Since 1 February, 2018 there have been a number of incidents across Wyndham where tradesmen's / women's utes have been broken into and power tools have been stolen.  The majority of vehicles have been parked on the street however some were also parked in driveways.  The vehicles are dual cab utes and trays with the tools being secured by tonneau cover (fibreglass and canvas) and in the case of trays, metal tool boxes secured with padlocks.  In most cases the offender/s use an unknown tool, most likely a jemmy or similar, to force open the locks, handles or windows of the utes.  Each theft has seen a significant amount of tools stolen from each vehicle.  The thefts occur mainly overnight with no specific areas or time identified.  There has been a total lack of eyewitnesses and no description of the offender/s or vehicle/s.  Opinion: -  Only utes containing tools have been broken into with no other property, such as wallets or mobile phones have been stolen -  The large area covered across Wyndham and the quantity of tools stolen suggests that offender/s are using a vehicle/s to commit these offences -  Due to a lack of eyewitnesses, it is highly likely the offences are being committed in the early morning hours when there are less people around.  Opportunities: -  Tradesmen / women to secure the tools by ensuring their utes and tool boxes are always locked, using good quality padlocks -  If available, park your ute in a secure garage -  Keep serial numbers of your power tools that will assist police recover the items if they are stolen -  Contact police by dialling 000 if you see any person/s breaking into utes or acting suspiciously in close proximity to a tradesman's / woman's ute.

The male was slashing blueberry bushes on the property when he hit a tree stump and the tractor rolled. The tractor had no rollover protection and the driver was fortunate to not receive more serious injuries. As can be seen in the attached photos there was a multi-agency response involving police, CFA and the ambulance service.  Off-road collisions are a reasonably common occurrence in the Frankston & Mornington Peninsula areas, given our semi-rural location. Police receive regular reports of private property motorbike accidents etc, however we have also been seeing increased amounts of incidents such as people not engaging handbrakes correctly in steep driveways and being crushed by their cars.  The message is to always maintain your concentration when in/around vehicles, either on or off road. Don't relax just because you're at home or somewhere else ""off-road"".

Police spoke to the male driver who was unable to provide any identification.  Police were not satisfied with the name that he had provided to them.   Police searched the driver and located a small quantity of methyl amphetamine (ice) and a knife in his possession.  The suspect was then conveyed back to the Knox Police Station where police used facial recognition technology, known as ‚ÄòIFace‚Äô to quickly uncover the suspects true identity.    Police allege that the accused is a 31 year old man formerly of a Belgrave address.  Police then established that the accused was wanted by numerous different police investigators for various offences across the eastern suburbs.    Several of our dedicated and hardworking Detectives were then woken at 3am and called in to investigate further.    The accused was subsequently interviewed at length by police before being formally charged and remanded in custody this afternoon during an out of sessions court hearing at the Knox Police Station.  The charges include: Breach of bail, Commit indictable offence whilst on bail, Aggravated carjacking, Assault with weapon, Theft of motor vehicle, theft (x2), Handle stolen goods (x10), Possess drug of dependence (x2), Dealing with proceeds of crime (x3), Possess controlled weapon and state false name & address.    Police are also investigating the use of stolen ID‚Äôs and credit cards.  Numerous further charges are expected to follow which are likely to include theft and deception related offences.  Victoria Police IFace technology allows police to photograph suspects and compare images taken to over a million images held on the police database.  In this case, Police identified the accused within seconds of his image being taken.

The elder had received a call from someone stating they were installing NBN in his street and he had to pay $600 to put the blue box on his house. He didn‚Äôt have a credit card so they told him to go to a local supermarket and purchase vouchers to the value of $600 and tell them the numbers and PIN‚Äôs over the phone.   So off he went and he bought the vouchers and it was when he discussed the PIN's with supermarket staff that alarm bells rang.

This has been achieved though the ongoing support of our partner agencies and you the community.  A notable decrease of Assault and related offences with Family Violence related assaults appearing to plateau.  This can be attributed to the strong focus and increased commitment to address the impact of Family Violence within our Community with the assistance of our partner agencies.  Further the recent announcement of additional dedicated resources to target Family Violence will complement our already strong commitment and dedication to tackling Family Violence within our community.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the community for their ongoing support of their local Police who continue to do some great work.  This is evident through the increased detection of drug cultivation & manufacturing which is a combination of great policing and community assistance in the supplying of information which is often the small piece required to enable Police to take relevant action.

Please slow down on the roads, drive to the conditions and be prepared for other driver's unexpected behaviour.  If you decide to drink at a function or event please ensure you have a designated driver or use a taxi/uber. This is a great opportunity to spend time with family and friends, not waiting in a hospital to find out whether someone you care about will have life-long injuries.  Parents of young drivers are asked to have conversations with their children about being patient and respectful on the roads and how rushing in traffic merely gets you to the next red traffic light a lot faster (or not at all).  We will have Police patrols out specifically tasked to ensuring safe driver behaviour and will be working hard to ensure you aren't endangered by other bad drivers. If you see bad or dangerous driving please contact 000 and provide the location, description of vehicle/driver and registration number. We will follow up.  Have a great and safe Easter 2018.

BEFUDDLED is a drink / drug driving operation targeting back roads and vehicles leaving licensed premises. Over the weekend Somerville HWP members working BEFUDDLED conducted 1267 alcohol PBT's & 15 POFT's for drugs. 5 drivers were found to be over the limit and a total of 4 vehicles were impounded for drink driving / driving whilst disqualified offences. On Saturday a driver failed to stop at a PBT site and tried to hide his car in a local car wash. He was processed in relation to unlicensed/ drink driving (0.100%) and evading police. He will appear at court at a later date and faces a lengthy disqualification period. The driver will also need to explain to his wife why her car was impounded for a period of 30 days. His reason for driving? ""To buy 2 litres of milk"".  On Sunday evening a driver was stopped at a PBT site in McCrae and when requested to accompany police to a breath testing vehicle he grabbed a can of Melbourne Bitter and sculled it. He then gave police some novel ideas about where they could put their Breath Testing machine. As he attempted to drink another can of Melbourne Bitter he was arrested for drunk and lodged at Rosebud Police Station. He was later charged & bailed for to failing to remain for a breath test, resist police and drunk. His licence was suspended and he will appear at Dromana Magistrates Court at a later date.   OIC of Somerville HWP Acting Senior Sergeant Peter Martin said ‚ÄúThere are still some drivers out there making very poor choices. There has been a lot of publicity in the last week about how many police will be supporting operations such as BEFUDDLED and NEXUS, so it shouldn‚Äôt come as any surprise to these idiots that they find themselves staring down the straw of a PBT device. I‚Äôm grateful that the local police members took them off the roads before they injured or killed someone.‚Äù",,19,1,4,

A 20 y.o. P plater from Chelsea had his black Toyota Supra impounded last night (see attached photo) after being observed doing a burnout at the intersection of Springvale Rd / Waterways Bvd in Aspendale Gardens. He will be receiving a summons to appear at court re Improper Use of a Motor Vehicle.   At about 1.30am on Wednesday 28th March the Peninsula Link Control Room advised the HWP nightshift unit that a vehicle was travelling South at approximately 150 km/h. A short time later the HWP unit observed a blue Holden ute travelling at extremely high speed past Golf Links Rd. Police then went after the vehicle and attempted an intercept with lights and siren, at which time the vehicle accelerated to an even higher speed. Police then  disengaged due to safety concerns, with the ute last checked speeding away at 201 km/h. Follow-up enquiries led police to a Mornington address, where the vehicle was impounded the following evening. A 28 y.o. Mornington man was also arrested and will face court at a later date for charges including reckless conduct endangering life, travelling at a dangerous speed and failing to stop when directed to do so by police.  Drivers who have their cars impounded lose them for a minimum of 30 days, and have to pay a fee of approximately $1000 to have them released. This is separate to any additional penalties that may be imposed on them at court.  Why not avoid the grief? Just do the right thing and you get to keep your car, keep your money and keep the roads safe.",,60,30,11,

The shed was remote from the farm house and the most disturbing items stolen included three firearms.    While the longarms were stored in a metal cabinet that met the minimum requirements of legislation;  they were not stored in a specialised firearm safe.  The shed contain tools and powertools, some of which were used in the burglary.    I have included a story I posted back in 2016 on this topic of firearm storage.  I urge all firearm owners to consider the suggestions.    Hot topic ‚Äì Review  your Firearm Security  Firearm safety does not end with the handling of a gun.  As a responsible registered firearm owner you do not want to see your firearms in the wrong hands.  It is not just the loss of a valuable asset; imagine learning your stolen firearm has been used in an illegal activity, often many years after the theft. Firearm owners need to consider the quality of their firearm storage cabinet.   The average collection of three modern quality firearms could be valued at over $3000.   My question; do you want to secure your valuable firearms in a cabinet that meets the MINIMUM requirement?     Why not exceed the minimum, especially when a quality firearm safe may be worth only $300 to $500.  The security, and peace of mind, is invaluable.   Now consider where you LOCATE your safe/cabinet.    Is your firearm safe in a shed on the farm?  While this will not breach any storage requirement; it is not the best location!  A shed or workshop may store tools that could assist a thief breaking into your firearm cabinet.  A farm shed remote from the house also has less foot traffic and low natural surveillance, often providing a thief with more time and opportunity to gain access to your firearms.  Often guns stolen from this type of  environment are missing for a week before the theft is noticed.    It is recommend that you secure the cabinet in a residential environment, such as the house or the garage and not in remote sheds, workshops or a holiday house.    Let us consider the worst case scenario, your guns are stolen.  An effective last line of defense could be a cabinet door activated electronic alarm and gun trigger lock.  The locks will stop them being used until some significant engineering work is completed.   Cabinet door alarms are simple and inexpensive.    My final recommendation is to establish security habits with handling and storage of your firearms.  Now that you have the security - USE IT.  Store you ammunition separately.    Use your locks and alarms.  Store your keys appropriately.  After a good day, take the time to remove firearms from your vehicle and store away appropriately.

After a bus ride to Melbourne Sgt ROBINSON and the children explored the circuit, watched some qualifying laps and enjoyed some of the off track entertainment. Many of the children were very impressed with the Roulette's flying display which flew overhead and the children picked out a car that they thought Sgt ROBINSON would look good driving around in, a $500,000 McLaren 570GT.   Sgt ROBINSON and the children met some of the Grand Prix promo workers who were kind enough to pose for a photo.   Lunch was eaten track side before we all loaded back onto the bus and headed home, we didn‚Äôt realise at this time that the bus ride home was going to be the most exciting part of the day.   After heading through Bacchus Marsh, a number of warning alarms activated on the bus and we were stuck, broken down on the side of the highway.  The bus company sorted us out quite quickly and everyone was returned home to Ballarat safely.  Sgt ROBINSON is currently in the process of engaging with the Ballarat Specialist School, who have classes attending the Farm Campus next to the Ballarat North Police Station, with the plan of commencing a program where Police interact regularly with special needs kids at the farm.   It is hoped that this interaction will break down some barriers for the children and encourage them to approach Police for help in the future if they require it.  Special needs children are often intimidated by Police and this program aims to show these children that Police are just regular people doing a job and that job is to help people in need.

Shortly before 2am yesterday morning members attempted to intercept a motorbike in Brunel Rd Seaford, because it had blue tape altering the number plate. The rider wasn't keen to speak police and sped off, reaching 148 km/h in the 60 zone. This seemed to be too much for his bike, as the chain then came off and began sparking on the road, at which time he rolled to a stop and then fell off. Police then finally got to speak to the uninjured 29 y.o. male rider from Seaford and found that he was already disqualified from riding/driving. He then also tested positive for methylamphetamine.   The bike was impounded for a minimum of 30 days, and during the inspection police found a switch had been installed to turn off the number plate light, which he did whilst evading interception.  The male stated he was heading to work at his nearby factory. Sometime in the near future he will be heading to the Frankston Magistrates' Court  where he will be answering a summons for charges including Driving Whilst Disqualified, Evading Police, Drug Driving, Altering Number Plates, Using an Unsafe Motor Vehicle & Speed Dangerous.

We saw a significant number of arrests in Shepparton and Mooroopna, while it was rounded out with a 25 year old Tatutra man being arrested for Tatura thefts.    The rewards are evident this week with a nice downward trend in criminal activity.    Of interest to the community are five recent thefts of fuel and chemicals from farms and outlying areas of Greater Shepparton.  Large quantities are involved - up to 2000 litres of deisel and 1000 litres of chemicals.  These thefts required access, time and  significant pumping, transportation and planning.    Be on the look out for trucks with tanks moving around rural areas at unusual times. Farms do not get deliveries at 2am in the morning!  Please take a note of  registrations, times and locations.    If you store deisel and chemicals on your property review your security; e.g.  lock sheds, use steel cages and note vehicles entering your property - they may be planning a return visit.

The weather is getting cooler and some fog has been rolling in, seriously decreasing visibility on our roads and creating dangerous conditions. How many cars came towards you out of the fog this morning without their headlights on? Hard to see weren't they?   It's common sense to put your headlights on in such conditions, and apart from that, it's also the law.  Road Rule 215.1.a states; ""A driver must not drive at night, or in hazardous weather conditions causing reduced visibility unless  the headlights, tail lights and number plate light fitted to the driver's vehicle are operating effectively and are clearly visible.""  Remember the law (and common sense) says HEADlights, not parking lights. Parking lights are for parking, not for use when driving.    The penalty if intercepted committing this offence is a $238 fine and 1 demerit point.  The penalty if someone pulls out in front of you because they couldn't see you in the fog without your headlights on could be much worse.       (Author: VP30339)",,59,11,49,

Police then observed this vehicle slowly reversing away from the scene, with the driver clearly struggling to control the car. They then approached the vehicle at which time the female driver argued about doing a preliminary breath test before blowing way over.  In her car she had a small whiskey glass with orange and vodka with ice in the centre console, whilst in the passenger side foot well she had a half full bottle of orange juice and vodka. She then argued about coming back to the station, after which she took two attempts to blow through the machine and allegedly provide a reading of 0.242%.  The 40 y.o. female driver from Seaford was already disqualified from driving and had multiple prior convictions for drink driving and refusing breath tests. She was then locked up for drunk and her car was impounded for a minimum of 30 days.  Many thanks to the drivers who brought this to the attention of police at the scene.

At approximately 7.45pm on Sunday evening the 29/04/2018 there was a hit run collision at the corner of Halpin and Malcolm Cresents, Shepparton (South end).  Thankfully no person was injuried, however the vehicle caused significant damage.  The vehicle, known to be red from parts left behind, has come to grief on the corner, mounted a curb, run over a couple of nature strip trees, side-swiped and destroyed a fence and then drove off.  It is believed the vehicle has damage to the front end and driver's side.  Also engine damage has caused it to leak fluid.   We have unconfirmed reports that the vehicle is a red Holden Commodore which was seen hooning in the area prior to the collision.    Police unsuccessfully followed a leaking fluid trail all the way to Archer Street.  Any sightings of a vehicle matching the above description in that area may be relevant.   We wish to speak to anyone who either witnessed the collision or saw a red vehicle with significant damage anywhere in the Shepparton area after that time.

We would like to thank you all for being responsible  with relation to drinking and driving.  During the same operation there were several people found to be driving without a licence, not displaying ""P"" or ""L"" plates when required, speeding and also failing to obey traffic control signals - which is disappointing.  The operation was held during both the afternoon and night time.

Stay aware of your surroundings and if possible walk on the footpath facing oncoming traffic.  Be alert in and around public transport hubs including bus stops and train stations.  There has been some thefts recently of mobile phones and bicycles in the Point Cook and Williams Landing transport areas.  Be observant, and if anyone appears suspicious or tries to distract you - keep a safe distance.  Never hand over your mobile phone if someone asks you to 'borrow it to make a phone call'.  If possible, do not walk around at night time by yourself.  Ensure that you have at least one ear free at all times when using headphones.  If you need emergency assistance or wish to report any suspicious behaviour call Triple Zero (000) or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.  Wyndham Police are actively patrolling your local area and conducting specific operations to ensure your safety, but there will be times that we are not in the 'right place at the right time' and need your help to ensure you, your family and friends stay safe.  #workingtogether",,32,18,23,

The AirWing patrol just like any other Police unit to deter, detect and apprehend offenders.  Caroline Springs and Melton Police Members get a lot of community enquires regarding the AirWing being overhead in the area. On many occasions the AirWing is pro-actively Patrolling the Caroline Springs and Melton area as part of our activities to prevent crime.   Some recent examples of the great work done by the AirWing to support your local Melton and Caroline Springs police units have been:  In the early hours of the 3rd May 2018 Airwing observed a stolen vehicle driving around Brookfield, with the occupants trying to break into cars. The AirWing alerted ground units and directed patrol units to the location of the stolen vehicle allowing Police units to move in and safely arrest four offenders.  On Saturday the 14th April 2018 Airwing observed a stolen vehicle concealed and abandoned in local parkland. Without their ability to see into the area Police on the ground would not have been able to locate it. The vehicle was retrieved and returned to its owner.  On the 4th March 2018 while Airwing were patrolling they located a vehicle involved in a Police ramming. The Airwing followed the vehicle and directed police units to it as the offenders travelled along the road unaware. The Airwing provided great information that allowed the local Sergeant to organise a planned and coordinated response, resulting in the safe intercept of the vehicle and arrest of the offenders.   The Airwing is a great resource to have and members of the community can be assured that their presence in the skies overhead is an important service that helps your local police operate safely and effectively to address crime.",,206,50,33,

This only encourages thieves.   - Ensure your car is left locked, that includes windows and doors. - Don't hide spare keys in the car. - At night, park your car in a garage or private driveway. Try not to leave it out on the street where it is accessible. - Affix one way screws to your vehicle as a large proportion of theft from motor cars involves the theft of number plates.",,14,3,3,

Money, handbags and electronics such as phones are attractive to thieves. Follow some simple advice to help protect you from thefts:  - Be confident, know where you're going and keep your eyes up - Walk purposefully, be aware of your surroundings, taking notice of street names etc. - At night, keep to well lit streets and avoid dark areas. Don't take short cuts through dark, deserted places. Walking in pairs or in a group is a good idea too. - Complain loudly if you are harassed and consider carrying a personal alarm - Always keep one ear free when using headphones - Keep handbags zipped up and never leave them unattended  - Place money , purses and wallets away immediately after a transaction - Keep valuables such as phones and other electronics hidden away when not in use. The less you have them out in public, the better.",,4,0,0,

Recently, we have had a number of serious injury collisions involving road cyclists around Frankston & the Mornington Peninsula; * 5th March Pt. Nepean Rd Sorrento: Cyclist rides into back of parked car. Sustains serious facial injuries and is taken to hospital. * 20th April Pt. Nepean Rd Rosebud; 90 y.o. pedestrian walks out in front of cyclist - both taken to hospital. * 21st April Nepean Hwy Frankston: Cyclist at speed down Oliver's Hill ran into a car which failed to give way whilst turning into the boat ramp entry road (not the first time this has occurred here). Cyclist taken to hospital with possible broken ribs. * 9th May Dundas St Rye: Cyclist at speed around Melbourne Rd roundabout hit by car not expecting cyclist to turn. Taken to hospital with possible internal injuries. * 12th May Nepean Hwy / Old Moorooduc Rd Dromana: Two road cyclists at speed collided when one failed to see the other whilst turning. Both riders taken to hospital, one with serious facial injuries.    We have many popular cycling routes throughout Frankston & the Mornington Peninsula, and these cyclists are sometimes travelling at speed.

There are a number of inquires being undertaken as it was done in quite a public area. If anyone has information as to the possible identity of the offenders please contact crime stoppers on 1800333000.  And here in an excerpt from excellent article on why stealing phones is pointless...  What you should do if your Apple iPhone gets stolen By Max Eddy -ZNews   Apple deserves some credit for creating consumer electronics that excite people so much that they're willing to camp out days and weeks just to buy them. It also means that people are more than willing to steal them, and if that happens you might lose a lot more than just a phone. You could easily lose your identity, your personal data, your money, and the trust of your friends. What to do if you've already lost your iPhone Let's start with the worst-case scenario: You've already lost your iPhone and you haven't secured your device with a passcode or set up Find My iPhone ‚Äî Apple's excellent anti-theft tool. Unfortunately, once the phone is out of your hands there's precious little you can do to help get it back. Without any protection on your phone, the most important task is mitigating the damage to you. Deactivate the phone with your network provider to prevent the thief from running up a lot of charges on your bill. Some providers will deactivate your device on their network, which prevents a thief from just resetting the device and slapping in a new SIM card. Note that once you deactivate service, you won't be able to communicate with your iPhone via Find My iPhone. But again, this scenario assumes that's not an option....

Over the past 4 weeks there have been 5 Residential Burglary and 14 TFMV offences occur in the Ocean Grove area. Nearly all of these offences have been during night time hours, with the burglaries occurring on residential premises, houses under construction and holiday homes and TFMVs occurring in the streets, driveways and carports of residential premises. The offences have included:  An increase in burglaries on Houses Under Construction/Renovation where power and hand tools have been stolen; o Although the offences initially appeared to be random in nature, the increase in Theft From Motor Vehicles where tools are also being stolen leads to the conclusion that the incidents are highly likely targeted.  It is recommend that Tradies ensure their work utilities and trailers are properly secured (locked) of an evening  and that preferably they are parked in garages or behind closed gates.  A senor flood light in the driveway where the vehicle is parked is a great deterrent to anybody loitering around.   Houses under construction should be secured correctly every evening and tradesmen should delay installing electrical house fittings like dishwashers, instant gas hot water systems, stoves and air conditioning units till just before handover of the property if possible.  The community are urge to dial 000 if they see any person(s) or vehicles hanging around the area and acting suspiciously.  Police would prefer to receive these calls immediately so that they can investigate at the time rather than subsequently.  If you have any information regarding the commission of these offences after the fact you are requested to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.  This can been done anonymously.

About the program: The Brimbank Youth Connect Program brings together young people through a common passion around sport and provides them with an opportunity to connect with their community and build their self-esteem.  Using a local hip hop star as a drawcard, we commenced the program with a forum to better understand issues facing young people and how police can help. We heard from youth about what they loved about their community, what they thought the issues facing their community were and what police can do better.  We often talk about tackling and preventing youth crime, but we rarely engage young people to be part of the conversation or solution.  More than 20 young people from CALD backgrounds shared their thoughts and ideas about policing, perceptions of safety and how the community can work better with police.  Following these discussions, we heard the young people wanted to be part of sport so we decided to host a basketball tournament at the Police Academy to teach and encourage sportsmanship and teamwork.  Police see an opportunity to ensure young people are engaged through what they are most interested and provide them with a safe space to do this.  Having positive relationships with young people is important to Victoria Police as it helps us establish trust, break down barriers and build strong relationships.  We recognise the importance of positive engagement with young people and that having a sense of purpose and prosocial networks can reduce engagement in criminal activity, which ultimately benefits the entire community.  This program is an initiative undertaken in partnership between Victoria Police, and the Multicultural Affairs and Social Cohesion Division of the Victorian Government‚Äôs Department of Premier and Cabinet.  The project aims to co-design and deliver initiatives that promote harmony and cultural understanding in local communities whilst building trust and confidence in Victoria Police.  This partnership approach ensures that issues impacting culturally and linguistically diverse communities (CALD) are identified through direct engagement with the community.  2. How many youths attended the tournament? More than 14 young people from the western suburbs attended the basketball tournament at the Police Academy on Saturday 12 May.  Participants were given the opportunity to represent their community in a supportive team environment.  The basketball teams integrated a mixture of young people and police in a friendly and competitive tournament.  The tournament encouraged inclusion, sportsmanship and teamwork, and it was great to see all the participates personal competitive drive whilst still supporting one another.  The winning team were awarded a trophy, which is currently been proudly displayed at the local secondary college.  All participants received an engraved medal and other players were excited to receive a new basketball and a certificate for winning a number of awards, including the ‚ÄòBlueys Award‚Äô for displaying fair and generous behaviour consistently throughout the game.  The tournament included a shared BBQ lunch, with food from a number of different cultures.  3. What activities went on? We also gave the young people a tour of the Police Academy before starting the basketball tournament. Everyone really enjoyed this, and were excited to be given rare behind-the-scenes access to the facilities.  During the tour, youth were shown the mock court, police station, a scenario village and the chapel and parade ground, where recruits graduate.  4. What's next? Following the success of this program, a number of participants have volunteered to be a part of a new Brimbank Youth Group, which police will work with to plan future activities.  Brimbank Police are also currently in consultation with a local high school to explore holding regular basketball tournaments after school.  There will also be another tournament in the future to see if the trophy can be taken from Saturday‚Äôs winning team.  5. How was it received? The youth were inspired to see the Police Academy, with many of them saying it was one of their highlights.  They enjoyed the basketball tournament, played competitively but kept the intended spirit of the day at the forefront.  Everyone had a great day getting to know one another and the tournament broke down some of the barriers between police and young people, giving police an opportunity to make strong and positive impressions on them for life.",,31,2,5,

Members from Cardinia Highway Patrol detected a worrying amount of people exceeding the speed limit at a dangerous level in their shift yesterday afternoon.  The first, a 23 year old driver from Nar Nar Goon, was detected traveling at 114km/h in a 100 zone on the Princes Freeway, Pakenham.  On the Princes Freeway, Nar Nar Goon police detected another 5 drivers exceeding the speed limit with a a 19 year old probationary driver from Trafalgar detected traveling at 125km/h in the 100 zone.

Every speed has a consequence and all drivers in these instances were issued with infringement notices.  Please pay attention to the speed zones - studies show that small increases in speed can have large increases in the level of injury or the likelihood of death. Equally though, small decreases in speed can significantly reduce the severity of injuries to the vulnerable human, or avoid the crash in the first place.  vp40485",,51,43,13,

Quite often I see posts by community members on this page, as well as locally supported social media pages, expressing concerns when they hear and/or see the police helicopter (otherwise known as POLAIR) in the skies over Wyndham. On occasion, police stations receive phone calls asking the same question.  Over recent times, POLAIR has proven to be an invaluable resource in addition to more traditional policing methods. They assist with a range of events both planned and unplanned.  There are substantial costs involved in maintaining and operating such a sophisticated machine however money is no object when it comes to our commitment to ensuring safety and service delivery in YOUR community. I personally as a supervisor, as well as my colleagues, often call on assistance from airborne resources without any thought other than to ensure maximum safety for our personnel and the community. By being able to have eyes observing from above we are able to identify and mitigate potential risks during an incident as well achieving our overall objective as safely and efficiently as possible.

The first incident occurred in Cressy between 31-May-2018 and the 01-Jun-2018 with approximately 12 Industrial sized batteries were stolen.  The 2nd incident was the mobile tower exchange building in Buckley which was entered on the same night as Cressy. Offenders have stolen 16 batteries each weighing 65kg each.  Lastly between 05-May-2018 06-May-2018 offenders have attended the Mobile Base Station on McCurdy Road Fyansford. Offenders have stolen 6 sets of 4 batteries 24 batteries in total.  The main function of these batteries is to provide power to the cell tower or exchange in the event of a power outage, with the capacity to keep telecommunication sites running for several hours without mains electrical power. This Police Division alone has approximately 228 of these particular towers.    The batteries that are being stolen are similar in appearance to 12V car batteries but are larger in size and have a higher output capacity. These batteries can be run down and then recharged a number of times due to the high amounts of Lithium. They come in numerous brands and sizes. They can weigh up to 80kg.  We seek the assistance of the public to supply information in relation to these thefts.  It is highly likely that there is more than one offender involved in these thefts and offender/s will probably be using a larger style vehicle with the offences occurring in isolated areas predominately.  If you see a larger style vehicle in the vicinity of one of these mobile towers or anyone acting suspiciously in the vicinity you are requested to dial 000 immediately.

The stolen car then disobeyed a red light at the Klauer St / Hartnett Dr intersection and almost caused a collision. The vehicle then broke down on Hartnett Dr and the thief took off on foot, after which he was caught and arrested.

Elder abuse is any act which causes harm to an older person and is carried out by someone they know and trust such as a family member or friend. The abuse may be physical, social, financial, psychological or sexual and can include mistreatment and neglect.  In many parts of the world elder abuse occurs with little recognition or response. It is a global social issue which affects the health, well-being, independence and human rights of millions of older people around the world, and an issue which deserves the attention of all in the community.  Individuals, communities, municipalities and organisations will come together across the globe to hold events on 15 June that raise awareness of elder abuse. Senior Rights Victoria encourages organisations to celebrate the positive contributions of older people in our communities.  ‚ÄúOlder people are essential in the fabric of our society. It‚Äôs time for us to acknowledge their importance and recognise they are entitled to the respect of their communities and especially their families,‚Äù Seniors Rights Victoria Manager Jenny Blakey said.  What can help improve the safety of someone at risk? ‚Ä¢ Ensuring older people are social connected is an important way to reduce an older persons vulnerability to abuse.  ‚Ä¢ Victims of elder abuse are sometimes socially isolated with a reliance on a carer, who may be their abuser. Keeping in contact with older friends and family and ensuring they are access with a trusted person to speak to is another way to reduce older people‚Äôs vulnerability to abuse.  ‚Ä¢ In-home services can also play an important role in monitoring and supporting someone at risk of elder abuse.

Thefts of motor vehicles is down 43.75 per cent and theft from motor vehicles is down 26.11 per cent.     We want to thank the community for assisting us in reducing these opportunistic crimes. We encourage you to continue your efforts by:  ‚Ä¢ affixing one way screws to reduce number plate theft ‚Ä¢ keeping valuables out of sight and secure, and ‚Ä¢ reporting suspicious behaviour or activity to Crime Stoppers on 1300 333 000.  Victoria Police continues to invest in the future of the Whittlesea Police Service Area.  Eight additional general duties police for Whittlesea have started arriving and will be tasked with providing an around-the-clock response to the community.    These resources together with 45 new positions received last year are enabling us to increase our patrols, traffic safety enforcement and targeted operations.  Hopefully you will have noticed our increased presence on the roads and at the Plenty Valley shopping precinct with its recent expansion.    Significant boosts of 39 new police are also being made to the divisional resources which also service the area.  These include more Highway Patrol, Family Violence, Crime Investigation Unit and Crime Scene Services police.  The additional investigators will respond to and deal with crimes which cause the greatest harm, building on the creation of the Serious Crime Taskforce which was established in 2017.  Following  feedback from our safety forums last year we are working with local agencies headed by the Whittlesea Local Learning and Employment Network on youth disengagement.  The project is funded by The Department of Justice and Regulation and will directly target local youth with risk factors that lead to early school departure.  It will tackle issues of family violence, drug and alcohol use and metal health from the youth perspective and link to relevant support agencies.   The Whittlesea PSA is also on the cutting edge of new organisation-wide changes with trials of body worn cameras and mobile devices.  These initiatives should help improve our accountability and efficiency which will give us more time to spend in the community.     We know there is more work to be done and will continue to strive to improve our service whilst further reducing crime.

PACER allows police and clinicians to work collaboratively to assess and treat people in a timely manner wherever they are in the community, including in their own home.

Buying things online is a great way to save a few bucks. Here are some things to consider when purchasing a mobile phone from a private seller.  If purchasing a second-hand mobile phone, this can be risky as the item may have been reported lost or stolen.  Request from the seller the phones IMEI number so you can check its status before purchasing at www.lost.amta.org.au.   It only provides details of phones reported lost or stolen at the time of the inquiry. There can be a 72-hour lag between when a mobile is reported lost and stolen to the carrier and showing ‚Äúblocked‚Äù on the website. If looking to purchase a phone via a Facebook Marketplace, all interactions are generally conducted through Facebook messenger or via comments people leave on items when they appear in the buy / swap / sell groups.  If possible, consider trying to obtain a contact phone number from the seller so more detailed communication can be entered into about the item.  Occasionally things don‚Äôt quite go to plan when parties meet to exchange cash for an item of interest.  Instances have occurred where victims‚Äô have had their cash stolen, their own mobile phone stolen, or even been physically assaulted during the course of the meeting.  Obtaining information from the seller such as their real name (as some people do create Facebook profiles under a pseudonym), a contact number or email address prior to arranging to meet can assist the police with avenues of inquiry if the transaction doesn‚Äôt quite go to plan.  1. Trust your instincts. 2. Don't go alone, have a friend accompany you to the agreed meeting place. 3. Insist to meet at a public place. 4. Do not meet in a secluded area. 5. Do not invite strangers into your home, and do not go into theirs. 6. Be cautious when buying/selling high value items. 7. Do the transaction during daylight hours. 8. If it sounds too good to be true, it normally is. 9. Tell a friend or family member about your plan to meet & make a purchase. 10. Always have your own phone with you. 11. Bring only the agreed-upon cash. 12. Don‚Äôt give out too much of your own personal information. 13. If the seller arrives at the purchase location in a vehicle, try to obtain the registration number.",,22,2,18,

The people involved were fortunate to avoid serious injury. In almost all cases, the vehicles involved were rendered undrivable and had to be towed from the scene. Some vehicles will be able to be repaired whilst others will most likely be written off.   A number of penalty notices have been issued for a range of offences including: ‚ÄòFail to give way/stop‚Äô; ‚ÄòFollow too close to the vehicle in front‚Äô and failing to obey traffic control signals. Penalties range from $238 to $396 and incur up to three demerit points.  Many of the collisions could have been avoided if drivers were concentrating on the task of driving and obeying all the relevant signs, lights, road markings and traffic conditions.  In one incident that occurred on Mt Dandenong Rd on Tuesday afternoon, a vehicle that failed to give way to oncoming traffic collided with another vehicle causing it to overturn. Fortunately, everyone involved escaped serious injury. Several lanes of the road were closed causing significant traffic disruption and both vehicles were written off.  Even minor collisions can attract significant penalties and much inconvenience with vehicle repairs, processing insurance claims and time without a means of transport.

No matter who the caller claims to be working for, before you provide personal details check to see if legitimate.  Request and record their details, then end call and contact the organisation (in this case Telstra) and ask to be transferred to the operator.  We doubt you will find them.

An elderly victim was recently targeted with the con men knocking on the victims door and asking if they wanted a tree cut down in their backyard. The victim agreed and the con men drove the victim to the bank to withdraw $2500 from the ATM, The incident was reported by the victims son in law  as victim was elderly and suffered from dementia.   Travelling con men are dodgy tradesmen who knock on doors of homes and small businesses, offering to do maintenance work.  They offer to do jobs such as driveway resurfacing, painting, roof repairs and carpet cleaning at a cheap rate. Often, they pressure people, offering 'today only' specials. Travelling con men ask for cash before starting work and frequently disappear as soon as you pay them. If they do any work, it is often unfinished or of a poor standard.  If you suspect a travelling con man is knocking on your door, do not answer. If you do speak to them, ask them to leave. If they refuse, they are breaking the law. Record as much information as you can, such as their name and vehicle registration.      Travelling con men incidents can be reported to the national travelling con men hotline on 1300 133 408 or to your your local police.

RAISING THE ISSUE WITH AN OLDER DRIVER  An older driver may not realise their driving skills are deteriorating. If you are concerned about their driving ability, give them your honest opinion and encourage them to speak to their doctor and to get an independent assessment.  Discuss your concerns early Family members and friends need to have ongoing safety discussions with older drivers, to calmly raise the sensitive issue of the need to think about modifying or stopping driving.   Conversations can be about the following: ‚Ä¢ How driving conditions have changed, with faster and heavier traffic that makes driving more stressful. ‚Ä¢ How changes in health can affect safe driving. ‚Ä¢ Any near misses or minor collisions, or incidents of getting lost while driving. ‚Ä¢ How self-regulating driving can be more enjoyable. See Vic Roads Helping them stay on the road page (e.g. restricting driving to times of the day and conditions that are less stressful). ‚Ä¢ Getting to know how to use public transport while the driver can still drive. ‚Ä¢ Driving expenses (e.g. registration, insurance, fuel, maintenance) and whether these are worth it if the driver is driving infrequently; the savings from not paying these expenses would pay for a lot of taxi trips. ‚Ä¢ Attending a older driving program or road safety education session. ‚Ä¢ Having a professional assessment by a reputable driving school or an occupational therapist specialising in driver assessment. ‚Ä¢ See 2005 American Society on Aging Business and Aging Award for We Need To Talk: Family (External link)  ‚Ä¢ Ideally, you should start these discussions well before there is a significant problem and the person needs to stop driving. ‚Ä¢ More information can also be found on Vic Roads Getting around without a car page.  Reporting unsafe drivers ‚Ä¢ If you have concerns that a driver poses a safety risk, you should notify VicRoads. If reported, that person may be asked to undergo a licence test if medical opinion suggests a test is appropriate. See Vic Roads Reporting a medical condition or driver page for more information.  Helping them stay on the road There may come a time when an older driver will need to reduce or stop driving, but the advice of their doctor and other health professionals is very important in this decision. A responsible driver will also listen carefully if their spouse, relatives or friends show concerns about their driving. With help, an ageing driver will often be able to modify their behaviour and gradually transition from driving to getting around without a car, rather than having to suddenly stop driving altogether.  Dealing with the effects of ageing Ageing can affect men and women differently. On average, women live six years longer than men. There is the very real possibility that, when their spouses die, women may have difficulty getting around. Family and friends of older or impaired drivers can help by encouraging them to: ‚Ä¢ visit the doctor and optometrist frequently for a check-up (family members could accompany them, to ensure that health and driving are discussed) ‚Ä¢ watch for changes in physical and mental health that may indicate a problem lies ahead ‚Ä¢ ensure that all health professionals and pharmacists know that they drive ‚Ä¢ undertake a driving assessment and if necessary a refresher course, to improve their confidence. Driving with ageing problems or increasing medical impairment Family and friends can help ageing or impaired drivers to think about what they would do if they need to reduce or stop driving.  Suggestions include: ‚Ä¢ planning ahead ‚Äì discuss the possibility of suffering from a health condition in the future that makes driving impossible and plan to share the driving with their spouse to get experience and confidence now ‚Ä¢ discussing alternative transport options with the extended family if both partners are unable to drive ‚Ä¢ contacting local councils to identify possible alternatives to private transport ‚Ä¢ considering moving them closer to family or friends or closer to public transport.  Self-regulation To compensate for reduced abilities older drivers generally self-regulate their driving, avoiding times and conditions in which they feel threatened or uncomfortable. However, a driver most at risk, for example, someone suffering from a mental disability, is also the least able to self-regulate. Some form of formal monitoring will also be needed from family and friends.  Sensible self-regulation strategies include:  ‚Ä¢ avoiding busy roads and peak hour traffic ‚Ä¢ avoiding glare by not driving at night or into the setting or rising sun ‚Ä¢ taking extra care when driving from shaded areas into sunlight and vice versa ‚Ä¢ avoiding driving in bad weather ‚Ä¢ not driving on days when you are not feeling at your best. If the older driver has not already modified their driving, family and friends could suggest that they try these self-regulation strategies. Family and friends can also help older drivers to try alternative ways of getting around while they are still driving. The older driver could use their car to drive to familiar places or to public transport, where parking is often free. This reduces their car expenses and they will not have to drive on busy, unfamiliar roads.  If the older person is not confident using public transport or a taxi, family and friends can help by taking the trip with them to help them gain confidence. Family and friends could drive the person to locations that may pose a challenge to an older driver. The older person may be able to offer something in return for this, such as making dinner, child minding or paying for petrol.  Road safety education sessions and programs for older drivers An older driver may benefit from attending a road safety education session or a driving program.  Sometimes free education sessions are advertised in the local press. Get contact details for community road safety education sessions on the Considering your driving future page.  Considering your driving future Find ways to improve and consider your driving choices. The information and checklists will encourage you to think about your driving and assist you to understand your legal obligations in relation to driving, Victoria‚Äôs licensing system and what is involved in having a driver assessment.  The safe driving checklist and workbook The questions in this checklist show possible problems and it‚Äôs important that you become aware and monitor them. Safe driving checklist in The Victorian Older Drivers' Handbook [PDF 75 Kb] There are several ways in which you might wish to use the checklist.  ‚Ä¢ read through yourself and spend some time thinking about the possible problems, or fill out the checklist and see how well you do.  ‚Ä¢ ask someone like your spouse or a regular passenger who travels with you to fill out the checklist and discuss the answers with you. ‚Ä¢ If you answered 'Yes' to six or more questions, you should speak to your doctor about whether or not it is safe to continue driving. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medical conditions or medicines may affect your driving. ‚Ä¢ You may also like to work through The Enhanced Driving Decisions Workbook (External link). After answering questions, feedback is provided on various concerns and what they mean for driving. Driving assessment ‚Ä¢ In some cases it might be a good idea to have your driving ability professionally assessed by a driving instructor or an occupational therapist who specialises in driver assessment.  Older driver programs There are programs that can help improve an older driver‚Äôs skills and confidence. The RACV Drive School Seniors Program provides professional advice about driving ability. It offers practical tuition and solutions to assist in maintaining mobility, as well as providing an honest assessment of driving.  Alternatively, you can attend a road safety education session. These courses provide road law updates, give people the chance to ask questions, and provide useful information about medical conditions, medicines and safe driving. You can contact the organisations below to enquire about the next session in your area and to book your place. You can also arrange to hold one of these seminars for your own community group.  ‚Ä¢ RACV Years Ahead program (External link) ‚Ä¢ TAC Community Mobility Program (External link)  ‚Ä¢ your local municipal council (External link) may also offer road safety sessions You may also want to visit the safe driving tips page.  Making the right decision In Victoria people can drive to any age as long as it is safe for them to do so. It is often the driver who decides to reduce or stop driving, perhaps because driving is becoming difficult or stressful, or because of advice from a doctor, family member or friend. You should plan early for when you may no longer want to, or be able to, drive. Otherwise there is a risk that this decision may be taken out of your hands due to a fitness to drive assessment. When people are suddenly confronted with the likelihood that it is no longer safe for them to drive, it often comes as a great shock. A person whose licence is suddenly taken away can often experience feelings of isolation and depression, which may compound other health problems. It can also lead to a greater dependence on others, such as family members and friends, which in turn can impose unwanted pressures on relationships. It is a good idea to start thinking about what you could do to get around if you need to (or decide to) reduce or stop driving, well before this becomes necessary. It is also important to understand the possible consequences of driving when you are unfit to drive. Aside from posing a possible safety risk to yourself and others, if you are in a crash your car insurance company may refuse to pay the claim. Think about where you live and how this will affect you if you become unable to drive. Would it be helpful to move closer to family and friends, public transport, shops and hospitals? Talk to your family and friends about how they could help you, learn to use public transport while you are still driving, and find out about other services that may help you to stay mobile or connected.",,11,6,15,

In 6 hours, police detected;  * 7 suspended drivers * 1 drug driver * 29 unregistered vehicles * 2 unlicensed drivers * 1 speeding driver * 1 unroadworthy vehicle  This operation will be run regularly on local roads, and is designed to create high visibility policing and reduce road trauma.

Yesterday I was horrified at the speed that some motorists drove at when passing police members who were standing on the roadside.  The next time the operation is run there will be police cars dedicated to enforcing these laws and educating motorists.""

The CIU, led by Detective Senior Constable McCann, has worked hard over the past eight months to identify offenders and hold them to account.   In December 2017 police executed a number of warrants in Melton West. A 34-year-old man was arrested and charged with 16 burglaries, nine attempted burglaries, 11 counts of theft and a further three charges of theft of motor vehicle.   The man was sentenced in June for an imprisonment period of 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.   As the investigation continued, further warrants were executed in Melton West in January, which resulted in a 36-year-old man being arrested and charged with 11 burglaries, five attempted burglaries, four thefts of motor vehicle, eight thefts, 14 counts of committing offences on bail, unlawful possession and going equipped to steal.  Last month the man was sentenced to 22 months of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months.   Months of hard work by Melton police and assistance from the community has resulted in two offenders being held in custody for crimes that caused a great deal of disruption to the everyday workings of many local businesses.

Various power tools including chain saws continue to be stolen in significant numbers, at a significant cost.  From 1st June to 16th July 2018 specific trends in relation to the theft of tools in the Division have been identified.  Over the above period a total of 91 stolen items were categorised as power tools, stolen from 44 recorded incidents of burglary, theft from vehicles, retail shop theft and other thefts.  A breakdown of the property types indicates that cordless drills & other drills (18), angle grinder (8), circular saw (8) and chain saw (7) make up the top group of property which also contains various other power tool types.    Popular quality brands are also likely the most prevalent, Makita (20) Ryobi (9), Milwaukee (9), Stihl (5), AEG (5), Hitachi (4), Bosch (2), Honda (2) and Dewalt (2).   Protecting Your Tools  Lock Them Up  A lot of tool theft is done on an opportunistic basis. This means that offenders are driving around looking for random targets. By leaving your tools unsecured you are giving them the opportunity to steal. If offenders walk up to your ute and see that your equipment is well secured, they are more likely to go looking somewhere else which provides an easier opportunity. As a minimum, all toolboxes should be properly secured to the tray of your ute and they should also have big solid locks on the lids or doors. Also consider the hinges, as weak hinges on some toolboxes can easily be broken.  Any large equipment that cannot fit in a toolbox should be locked to your vehicle with a chain and padlock. Ladders should be secured in a similar way, or even taken off the ute and placed inside your home if possible. Most average padlocks can be easily and quietly cut using bolt cutters, and other types of toolbox locks can often be jemmied open with a crowbar, so don‚Äôt skimp on your security devices or quality of tool box.  Keep Them Out Of Sight  Most tool thefts occur from utes parked outside of a residential home during the evening. The easiest way to stop this happening is to park your ute or trailer inside your garage or shed. If you already have two cars in the garage, or if your garage doubles as storage space for the rest of your gear it may not be possible to park inside. In this case at least consider parking off the street. If you have room down the side of your house this can be a good option. A movement sensor light installed above this space though will also act as a good deterrent.  ID Your Equipment  Despite your best efforts, there is nothing you can do that will 100% guarantee the safety of our tools. So if they are going to get stolen, we want to make sure that we have the best chance of recovering them. All of your valuable tools should be engraved with your driver‚Äôs licence number.  By using your licence number and including the State (e.g. V for Victoria ‚Äì V123456789) at the start police will be able to quickly find you in their system and will have your current address details on file. . This may not stop someone from stealing them, but it will make them harder to sell and easier to identify if the police locate a large quantity of tools in the possession of an offender.  It is also a good idea to keep a comprehensive record of each and every tool, from your most expensive power tools through to every little drill bit and screwdriver. Although initially is a long process it will make reporting to police and insurance companies an easier process.  Include make, model number and serial numbers.  Essentially there are four main tips to protect your tools. ‚Ä¢ Lock them up ‚Ä¢ Keep them out of sight ‚Ä¢ ID your equipment and tools ‚Ä¢ Keep them properly insured Your tools are a big part of your ability to earn an income as a tradesman, so it is worth making the effort to keep them safe.",,11,20,28,

Five minutes later they were called to where the same vehicle had crashed into a pole in Towerhill Rd. The vehicle was a write-off, but fortunately neither the driver or any other person was injured.  The 55 y.o. driver from Frankston South was then conveyed to Frankston Police Station where he underwent a breath test and allegedly blew 0.227%. His licence was immediately suspended and he faces a long driving ban at court. He told police that he had been drinking wine during the afternoon and had developed a hunger for Chinese food, so went out to get some.  Whilst drug driving has become more and more prevalent, drink driving remains a problem and the outcomes can be tragic.

One tyre was worn through to the steel belt underneath.  Her vehicle was grounded due to the appalling condition of the tyres that would have affected her vehicle handling and braking performance.   She was also issued with a $403 penalty notice and will have to present her vehicle to VicRoads in order to clear the defect notice.  Police would like to remind all motorists to conduct regular checks to ensure that their vehicle tyres are safe and have sufficient tread depth.   During winter, the weather is often poor and a worn tyre can severely compromise vehicle braking and handling in wet conditions.  A check of the vehicle lights (headlights, brake lights, tail lights, etc) should also be conducted regularly. A blown headlight can significantly reduce your seeing distance and visibility to other vehicles at night or in poor weather.

The police members observed recent accident damage to the Territory, and an enquiry over the police radio confirmed it had been involved in a nearby hit-run collision a short time before.

The Somerville HWP Police Nightshift unit was patrolling in Mornington at about 2am this morning when the officers saw a vehicle driving with false number plates attached. It was then intercepted, and police spoke to the 44 y.o. male driver from Mornington, who allegedly ""smelt like a brewery"". The driver admitted not having a licence since losing it back in 2011 for a previous drink driving conviction, and a check on the vehicle showed that it was unregistered.   The driver was then taken back to the Mornington Police Station where he was breath tested and blew 0.176%. He was also drug tested which returned a positive result for MDMA (Ecstasy) & Methylamphetamine (""Ice"").   The driver's car was then impounded and towed away, but not before he kicked dents into virtually every side panel of his defenceless blue Honda Civic. He was then collected by a ""none too happy"" wife, and will appear in court in due course.  This was one of three drug-drivers that the unit picked up during their shift. The others were a 38 y.o. male from Mt. Martha who was intercepted near Mornington Racecourse at 1am, and a 40 y.o. male from Endeavour Hills who was intercepted on Thompsons Rd near Western Port Hwy at 11pm.   Drug drivers were involved in 42 collisions in the Frankston & Mornington Peninsula areas in 2017. One of those was a fatality, and 16 resulted in serious injuries.

Some important issues were raised that we wish to share with the broader community.  ¬∑       Why were no arrests made? We understand this incident was very confronting for the residents affected by this behaviour and generally the need to make arrests is an important part of law enforcement. However the nature of the incident made identity of actual offenders difficult for police to determine at the time and would slow our response down considerably. The priority for the police was the safety of residents and the preservation of the peace. Determination of which person in the group threw rocks could come later but we wanted to protect our community.  ¬∑       Why did the Public Order Response Team go in with equipment on? Rocks had been thrown and for the members‚Äô safety it was thought appropriate.  ¬∑       Why was the Air Wing present? We have the Air Wing there to record from overhead the behaviour of the youths and feedback to the supervisors on the ground. They also provided us with some excellent footage of the people involved which might assist later.  ¬∑       Why did police tell people to go back inside their houses? This occurred at the time we were about to take steps to disperse the youths. It was about ensuring everyone was safe in moving around the area. We also didn‚Äôt want arguments between residents and the youths slowing the dispersal process.  ¬∑       What are police doing about this going forward? We have continued to task patrols to the area. Local police have been out and about on foot and in marked and unmarked vehicles, supported by specialist resources including the Mounted Branch whose presence will continue in coming nights.  ¬∑       We have supported the investigation team‚Äôs enquiries by assisting with a door knock, providing a letter drop to residents and communicating to people through Crime Stoppers and Eyewatch.  ¬∑       Our Taskforce Wayward detectives are working hard on the investigation ‚Äì compiling evidence, speaking to witnesses and building a picture of what happened so we can hold those responsible to account for their behaviour.   ¬∑       Police have engaged with the school principals network to speak with students to discourage further involvement in this type of behaviour, establish a point of contact with Victoria Police and to assist any persons involved.   ¬∑       We have met with Melton City Council and the Taylors Hill Safety Group ‚Äì which comprises police, community members, as well as local, state and federal government stakeholders ‚Äì to discuss what happened and how we work together to prevent it from happening in future.  ¬∑       Police will continue to work closely with community stakeholders and groups that manage youths and will do our best to ensure this does not occur again.  Finally, we want to reassure you ‚Äì the community ‚Äì that your safety is our priority. We have a standing response plan in place and are well-resourced and prepared to respond to any issues that may arise.  If anyone witnessed the incident on Wednesday night or has any information which may assist police in their investigation, please contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.

A few of the key changes are summarised below:   1. Windows tinting  Provided that at least a side rear vision mirror is fitted to each side of a vehicle, the minimum visible light transmittance (VLT) for windows located behind the driver changes to:  ‚Ä¢ 0% for vehicles primarily designed for the carriage of goods, or ‚Ä¢ 20% for all other light vehicles  2. Additional headlights  Additional headlights will no longer have to be fitted in pairs to permit the fitment of LED light bars. Up to 4 additional headlights will be allowed to be fitted to a vehicle, provided that they are fitted in a way so that they are facing forward and symmetrical in relation to the vehicle‚Äôs centre line.  3. Fitting brake lights  To retain the design value of vintage and historical vehicles manufactured before 1 January 1973, a light fitted to a vehicle that has dual functions as a brake light and a direction indicator light will be treated as a brake light.  The change does not apply to vehicles manufactured after 1 January 1973. Find out more about the changes here:  http://bit.ly/vehiclestandardsVR",,8,2,12,

Somerville HWP Police first observed their red Holden Commodore just after 11pm last night, speeding along Frankston Gardens Dr away from an area where a large amount of tyre smoke was hanging in the air. When pulled over, the car's bald tyres stank of burning rubber, and the 24 y.o. male driver from Langwarrin was issued with 3 tickets (totalling $1128) and his car was defected for numerous faults.   Then, just after midnight (about an hour later), the same vehicle was seen deliberately losing traction on Colemans Rd Carrum Downs and doing a burnout. Somerville HWP police then intercepted the vehicle for a 2nd time, finding a 23 y.o. male from Keysborough driving and the owner now sitting in the passenger seat. The Commodore was then impounded and towed away for a minimum of a month (release fee $961) and the driver will face court at a later date for numerous road policing offences.  The Carrum Downs Industrial Estate has long been an area subject to complaints about hoon behaviour, and it is regularly patrolled by local police and HWP units.

This operation utilises an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) vehicle to scan passing vehicles. As a result of this operation, Somerville HWP were successful in removing from the roads: 3 Suspended drivers, 2 Disqualified drivers, 10 Unregistered vehicles, 1 Drug driver & 1 False Number Plates. Of those, 2 of the cars were impounded and towed away for 30 days due to the drivers having prior convictions for the same offence.    As was announced on our Eyewatch pages on July 19, enforcement of vehicles passing station emergency vehicles at dangerous speeds was also undertaken. During the operation, 13 motorists were intercepted and fined $282 for ‚ÄúOvertaking a police vehicle / emergency vehicle with flashing red / blue lights operating at a speed greater than 40 km/h‚Äù. One of these incidents involved a MICA Ambulance which had stopped at the side of the road due to a medical emergency with a patient that they were carrying.  Acting Senior Sergeant Peter MARTIN, Unit Commander of Somerville HWP was scathing in his description of these motorists; ‚ÄúFair warning was given that we‚Äôd be enforcing this offence strenuously. My members are continually getting into and out of vehicles at these locations. Many motorists don‚Äôt realise just how dangerous it is to be driving past an emergency worker when there is literally half a metre or less between the vehicle and the emergency worker. ‚ÄúA car travelling at 100 km/h travels 28 metres in just one second. Sometimes even the wind rush from a passing car puts emergency workers at risk. The law has been in for well over 12 months but even if it wasn‚Äôt a law, it‚Äôs just common sense not to endanger someone on the roadside.‚Äù  Please drive safely.  (VP30339)",,70,75,43,

On arrival they found a light pole in the centre median strip had been knocked over, which was blocking one Eastbound & one Westbound lane. The car involved had left the scene, leaving behind a number plate which had come off in the collision.  Enquiries then led police to a nearby address where the vehicle and its 20 y.o. (uninjured) male driver were located. The driver said he was making a right turn from Centre Rd into Cranbourne Rd, and lost control after accelerating too heavily on the wet road. He was then taken to the Frankston Police Station for a breath test and allegedly blew 0.144%. His probationary licence was immediately suspended pending being summonsed to court, where he faces a substantial fine and a lengthy loss of licence. His still driveable XR6 Ford Ute was impounded for 30 days with a release fee of $961. He will also need to have an alcohol interlock fitted to ANY vehicle he drives for a minimum of 6 months when he regains his licence.  This young man now has no licence, no car, heavy fines and ran the risk of seriously injuring himself and other people.   Please think before you get behind the wheel.  Are you right to drive?

In many cases the person receiving this invoice has used the business or company for legitimate means and go ahead and make payment without realising it is not the actual business that is being paid.   These invoices arrive via email and people are encouraged to contact the company directly and confirm if these is any outstanding payments due and the amount requested before proceeding any further. An alternative scam is a business who is regularly invoiced by a supplier receives notification that a new account for payment has been created.  We strongly advise the business to contact their supplier and confirm these details prior to payment.     Some useful tips to protect yourself: DON‚ÄôT respond to offers, deals or requests for your details. Stop and take time to independently check the offer. ‚Ä¢ DON‚ÄôT rely on glowing testimonials: find solid evidence from independent sources (not those provided with the offer). ‚Ä¢ ALWAYS type in the address of a website of a bank, business or authority on the internet rather than opening a link as it‚Äôs safer. ‚Ä¢ ALWAYS look up phone numbers in an independent directory, when you wish to check if a request or offer is genuine. ‚Ä¢ NEVER click on a link provided in an unsolicited email as it will probably lead to a fake website designed to trap you. ‚Ä¢ NEVER use phone numbers provided with unsolicited requests or offers as they probably connect you to fakes who will try to trap you with lies. ‚Ä¢ NEVER respond to out of the blue requests for your personal details. ‚Ä¢ NEVER send money or give credit card, account or other personal details to anyone who makes unsolicited offers or requests for information.

Some left turning drivers are coming to a halt at the give way sign unnecessarily, causing traffic on Coolart Rd to bank back from the intersection, interrupting traffic flow and increasing the chance of rear-end collisions.   Drivers turning left out of Coolart Rd have a dedicated merging lane which they MUST use when making this left turn. Merging straight out of Coolart Rd into the Westbound lane of Frankston-Flinders Rd across the solid white line is illegal. Left turning vehicles should turn into the merging lane, get up to an appropriate speed and then whilst using their right indicator, merge across the broken line when safe to do, much like the merging lane onto a freeway. Similarly, the onus is on the merging vehicle crossing the white broken line to give way to Westbound through traffic.   The attached overhead photo from Google Maps shows the correct left turn path marked with the red line. The blue line shows Westbound Frankston-Flinders Rd traffic proceeding past the intersection, initially separated from the merging lane by the solid white line.  The only time that left turners need to come to a halt, is when cars ahead of them are waiting to turn right and are blocking the entry into the left turn merge lane.  Please drive safely.

She will face Frankston Magistrates' Court at a later date for multiple road policing offences.  The female driver then made a phone call to arrange a ride home, and shortly after a 49 y.o. male also from Karingal drove up. He was then drug tested and, you guessed it, also allegedly went positive to methylamphetamine.

Whatever it is, cup of tea, shower, put the dog out, whatever we need our community to include in their nightly rountine to ensure that they have locked their car and their valuables arent in the vehicle.  This isnt about victim blaming its about reducing the opportunity, its about target hardening and taking responsibility for your own crime prevention.  We would also like to hear from our community if they see or disturb any person(s) acting suspiciously around our suburban streets particularily overnight.

The first incident occurred on the 12 September when a 21-year-old woman was walking west along the trail near Moss Road just before 7pm. Investigators have been told she was grabbed from behind around the waist before the local woman managed to break free. The man, who was wearing dark clothing, fled in an easterly direction towards Melaluka Road.  Detectives are investigating whether this incident is linked to a similar reported incident on the trail last night (18 September).  Investigators have been told an 18-year-old Leopold woman was riding her bicycle along the trail between Melaluka Road and Kensington Road when she was grabbed by an unknown man just before 11.30pm.  The woman fought off the man, who was armed with a knife, before getting back on her bicycle and riding away, leaving her back pack behind. Police conducted a search of the area but were unable to locate the man. The man was perceived to be Caucasian in appearance, aged in his 40s, with a pale completion, short grey/brown hair and a medium to heavy build.  It‚Äôs believed he was wearing a black hooded top and ripped tracksuit pants.  Geelong Superintendent Craig Gillard said Geelong Police took the personal safety of every member of their community very seriously.   ‚ÄúLocal detectives along with specialist unit detectives from Melbourne are investigating these reported incidents. ‚ÄúYou will see a greater police presence in the area over the coming days. ‚ÄúThis will include vehicle patrols, bicycle patrols and police quad bikes throughout the day and night. ‚ÄúI want to assure the residents of Greater Geelong that police are committing all available resources to these investigations with a view to holding those responsible to account,‚Äù he said.

To date, three homes have been raided under the auspices of Operation WIPEOUT resulting in the seizure of large quantities of cash and a variety of illicit drugs. A total of five offenders have been processed with two of the five still incarcerated. As recently as yesterday, members from Knox Police swooped on a residential premises in Knoxfield arresting a 34 year old female and a 40 year old male. A large cache of illicit drugs were seized during the raid including approximately 170 Ecstasy tablets, 90 LSD tabs, one pound of Cannabis, one ounce of Crystal Methyl-amphetamine and smaller amounts of Cocaine and Magic Mushrooms. Investigators also seized in excess of $50,000 cash from the address believed to be the proceeds of drug trafficking and will allege the occupants were running what could ostensibly be described as a commercial drug trafficking enterprise from the address. An extensive surveillance network protected the property. Sergeant McGIBBONY from Knox Police says Operation ‚ÄòWIPEOUT‚Äô has been conceptualised with the express purpose of stamping out illicit drug trafficking within the Knox PSA. This type of crime has a flow on effect in terms of both violent and volume crime and we want to assure the public we take an extremely dim view on this behaviour and will do all within our power to combat it. To the general public, if you are aware of persons engaging in illicit drug trafficking we implore you to contact us here at Knox or alternatively via crime stoppers on 1800 333 000. To those individuals engaging in this type of behaviour be warned ‚Äì you are officially on notice. Desist with your activities or expect a visit from Operation ‚ÄòWIPEOUT‚Äô members in the near future‚Äô.",,67,6,10,
