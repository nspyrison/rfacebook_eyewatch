This may have been contributed to by people making longer than usual journeys for father’s day. It is important to bring the fatigue risk to the front of everyone’s minds ahead of school holidays , football finals and the country race meetings which involve driving longer distances. We Want people to look ahead and plan their journeys, to allow extra time than what the GPS states, to plan rest periods over long distances particularly when driving at times when they would normally be asleep. The most important message is if you are feeling tired, if you are turning up the radio or winding down the window it is time to pull over and rest. Fatigue is something we cannot fight indefinitely and when we try it has dire consequences. Encourage your visitors who are driving to see you to plan their trip and children travelling back from University to make sure they are well rested before they drive’",,,Janine Walker,119,0,98,104,0.300578,417,2,417,346,0,0,346,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,741,1,1
