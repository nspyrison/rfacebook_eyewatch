Held at multiple locations in Wyndham including the Wyndham North Police Station, the six-week program was designed to equip aspiring young leaders from diverse backgrounds with the communication, leadership and networking skills they need to confidently contribute to their local community.  The program provided the youth, who were identified as having strong networks with community, with practical and theoretical training so they can be a voice for diversity, create a shared sense of cohesion and connect with disengaged youth peers.  “We have youth from culturally diverse backgrounds in our community who understand what cultural exclusion means and they are motivated to use this experience to make their local area an even better place to live. Through this training program, we have developed talented young leaders who can be positive influences to inspire their own communities and create social change,” Sergeant Tim Jacobs said.

It originates from an international telephone call.  The caller states they are from a Telstra call centre.    They want you to login to your computer.  Their purpose is to illegally access your internet banking details.    Recommended action:  Hang Up. And report via the Scam Watch website.  No matter who the caller claims to be working for, before you provide personal details check to see if legitimate.  Request and record their details, then end call and contact the organisation (in this case Telstra) and ask to be transferred to the operator.  We doubt you will find them.  You can also log the scam with that organisation while making this call.   Discuss this scam with vulnerable members of your family to build resilience.",,25,19,46,

Neither driver was injured.  3:50PM;  Eastlink, Rowville;  A 26 year old truck driver travelling South on Eastlink at the BP service centre changed lanes without giving way and collided with a car travelling in the same direction dragging it along the road for some distance.

In December 2017 police executed a number of warrants in Melton West. A 34-year-old man was arrested and charged with 16 burglaries, nine attempted burglaries, 11 counts of theft and a further three charges of theft of motor vehicle.   The man was sentenced in June for an imprisonment period of 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.   As the investigation continued, further warrants were executed in Melton West in January, which resulted in a 36-year-old man being arrested and charged with 11 burglaries, five attempted burglaries, four thefts of motor vehicle, eight thefts, 14 counts of committing offences on bail, unlawful possession and going equipped to steal.  Last month the man was sentenced to 22 months of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months.   Months of hard work by Melton police and assistance from the community has resulted in two offenders being held in custody for crimes that caused a great deal of disruption to the everyday workings of many local businesses.

The bylaw also states that the driver of a motor vehicle must not stop or park in close proximity to a hoon event without lawful excuse.   WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?   If you are spectator which includes the driver or a passenger of a vehicle that is located (thats right, located) in an area where “Hoon” events are being undertaken, Police and local bylaw officers have the power to and will issue you with an $800 infringement notice.   This additional infringement notice is also on top of impound fees, Magistrates penalties imposed, solicitor fees at Court etc etc for those caught participating in hoon activity.    We urge you to like/comment/share this post to get the message out there that so that your family and friends are aware of this new bylaw and encourage them not to attend or participate in such events as Police are taking a zero tolerance approach to hoon activity and will be heavily enforcing this bylaw.   The best way to report a hoon incident is through the Crime Stoppers Website www.crimestoppersvic.com.au or you if you prefer, you can call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 and make an anonymous report    If the hoon activity is in progress immediately call Police on 000.

One tyre was worn through to the steel belt underneath.  Her vehicle was grounded due to the appalling condition of the tyres that would have affected her vehicle handling and braking performance.   She was also issued with a $403 penalty notice and will have to present her vehicle to VicRoads in order to clear the defect notice.  Police would like to remind all motorists to conduct regular checks to ensure that their vehicle tyres are safe and have sufficient tread depth.   During winter, the weather is often poor and a worn tyre can severely compromise vehicle braking and handling in wet conditions.  A check of the vehicle lights (headlights, brake lights, tail lights, etc) should also be conducted regularly. A blown headlight can significantly reduce your seeing distance and visibility to other vehicles at night or in poor weather.

Some important issues were raised that we wish to share with the broader community.  ·       Why were no arrests made? We understand this incident was very confronting for the residents affected by this behaviour and generally the need to make arrests is an important part of law enforcement. However the nature of the incident made identity of actual offenders difficult for police to determine at the time and would slow our response down considerably. The priority for the police was the safety of residents and the preservation of the peace. Determination of which person in the group threw rocks could come later but we wanted to protect our community.  ·       Why did the Public Order Response Team go in with equipment on? Rocks had been thrown and for the members’ safety it was thought appropriate.  ·       Why was the Air Wing present? We have the Air Wing there to record from overhead the behaviour of the youths and feedback to the supervisors on the ground. They also provided us with some excellent footage of the people involved which might assist later.  ·       Why did police tell people to go back inside their houses? This occurred at the time we were about to take steps to disperse the youths. It was about ensuring everyone was safe in moving around the area. We also didn’t want arguments between residents and the youths slowing the dispersal process.  ·       What are police doing about this going forward? We have continued to task patrols to the area. Local police have been out and about on foot and in marked and unmarked vehicles, supported by specialist resources including the Mounted Branch whose presence will continue in coming nights.  ·       We have supported the investigation team’s enquiries by assisting with a door knock, providing a letter drop to residents and communicating to people through Crime Stoppers and Eyewatch.  ·       Our Taskforce Wayward detectives are working hard on the investigation – compiling evidence, speaking to witnesses and building a picture of what happened so we can hold those responsible to account for their behaviour.   ·       Police have engaged with the school principals network to speak with students to discourage further involvement in this type of behaviour, establish a point of contact with Victoria Police and to assist any persons involved.   ·       We have met with Melton City Council and the Taylors Hill Safety Group – which comprises police, community members, as well as local, state and federal government stakeholders – to discuss what happened and how we work together to prevent it from happening in future.  ·       Police will continue to work closely with community stakeholders and groups that manage youths and will do our best to ensure this does not occur again.  Finally, we want to reassure you – the community – that your safety is our priority. We have a standing response plan in place and are well-resourced and prepared to respond to any issues that may arise.  If anyone witnessed the incident on Wednesday night or has any information which may assist police in their investigation, please contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.

A few of the key changes are summarised below:   1. Windows tinting  Provided that at least a side rear vision mirror is fitted to each side of a vehicle, the minimum visible light transmittance (VLT) for windows located behind the driver changes to:  • 0% for vehicles primarily designed for the carriage of goods, or • 20% for all other light vehicles  2. Additional headlights  Additional headlights will no longer have to be fitted in pairs to permit the fitment of LED light bars. Up to 4 additional headlights will be allowed to be fitted to a vehicle, provided that they are fitted in a way so that they are facing forward and symmetrical in relation to the vehicle’s centre line.  3. Fitting brake lights  To retain the design value of vintage and historical vehicles manufactured before 1 January 1973, a light fitted to a vehicle that has dual functions as a brake light and a direction indicator light will be treated as a brake light.  The change does not apply to vehicles manufactured after 1 January 1973. Find out more about the changes here:  http://bit.ly/vehiclestandardsVR",,8,2,12,

This suggests crossing users are taking unnecessary risks.   · This kind of risky behaviour comes with penalties. Break the law at a railway line and you risk being fined up to $806.  · When people walk along train tracks, or cross against the signals, they are taking a huge risk – one that too often ends in tragedy.  · The tragedy that comes with train collisions can be avoided by pedestrians and road users exercising due care and obeying road rules.  · Road users should slow down, look carefully and listen for trains when there is a crossing ahead and obey any traffic signals.  · You must not cross when gates and booms are operating or when red lights are flashing.  · Other safety tips include: Ø Make sure to dismount your bike before walking across the level crossing Ø Hold on to prams on platforms to ensure the safety of children Ø Don’t use phones or headphones near trains, train tracks and crossings to avoid being distracted",,5,1,4,

Local Police are urging anyone who thinks they may have a warrant out for their arrest to attend their Local Police Station to check and get the matter sorted.   Arrest warrants never go away and the warrant gives Police the power to:  *Break, enter and search any place where the person named or described in the warrant is suspected to be; and *Arrest the person named or described in the warrant  Avoid looking over your shoulder or worrying every time you see a Police Officer or Vehicle and get the matter sorted before we come to you.   In the coming weeks our Eye Watch Page will be releasing images of people with outstanding warrants, so to avoid other people knowing your business attend a Police Station so we can execute your warrant/s.   By coming into a Police Station on your own accord puts you in a much better position to be granted bail than if we have to locate you and take you before the court to ensure your appearance at any future court dates.   Alternatively if you believe someone you know has a warrant for their arrest and you know their whereabouts and want us to arrest them contact the Keilor Downs Police Station on 9365 3333 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

A 19 year old female driver and her 15 year old passenger were fortunate to avoid serious injury when the car they were in lost control on the exit ramp from Eastlink to Ringwood Bypass last night.   Their vehicle overturned after colliding with the roadside embankment and a light pole.  It is believed a combination of wet roads and driver inexperience contributed to the collision.  There is no information to suggest that speed was a factor in the collision.

Despite the poor weather conditions, approximately 900 vehicles were scanned by the ANPR and a number of offences detected.  • Two drivers returned positive results for illicit drugs. • One driver was detected driving on a suspended driver licence. Their vehicle was found to be defective and they did not have their headlights on. They will face Court in relation to all matters. • Two vehicles were found to be unregistered. The owners were issued with $806 penalty notices. • Nine defect notices were issued to drivers who came through the site with headlights that were not working. In most instances, vehicles had a single non-operational headlight. Police are reminding drivers that even a single non-functioning headlight greatly reduces your visibility of the road ahead and to other vehicles at night and in poor weather conditions. These drivers will have to effect repairs to their vehicles and present them to VicRoads. • ..and finally; a 20 year old male driver was detected driving on a learner permit without an accompanying full licence holder or L-plates displayed. When questioned, the male stated that he “just wanted to go for a drive”. It turned out to be an expensive night out as he was subsequently issued with penalty notices totalling $967!  Further operations of this kind will be conducted in future to detect unlicenced or impaired drivers and remove defective vehicles from the road.  #roadtozero",,61,27,6,

In many cases the person receiving this invoice has used the business or company for legitimate means and go ahead and make payment without realising it is not the actual business that is being paid.   These invoices arrive via email and people are encouraged to contact the company directly and confirm if these is any outstanding payments due and the amount requested before proceeding any further. An alternative scam is a business who is regularly invoiced by a supplier receives notification that a new account for payment has been created.  We strongly advise the business to contact their supplier and confirm these details prior to payment.     Some useful tips to protect yourself: DON’T respond to offers, deals or requests for your details. Stop and take time to independently check the offer. • DON’T rely on glowing testimonials: find solid evidence from independent sources (not those provided with the offer). • ALWAYS type in the address of a website of a bank, business or authority on the internet rather than opening a link as it’s safer. • ALWAYS look up phone numbers in an independent directory, when you wish to check if a request or offer is genuine. • NEVER click on a link provided in an unsolicited email as it will probably lead to a fake website designed to trap you. • NEVER use phone numbers provided with unsolicited requests or offers as they probably connect you to fakes who will try to trap you with lies. • NEVER respond to out of the blue requests for your personal details. • NEVER send money or give credit card, account or other personal details to anyone who makes unsolicited offers or requests for information.

Courtesy of the Victoria Police Historical Society, we thought we’d take a trip down memory lane with this story from 1949.  Enjoy…  John HODGSON - First Constable. 7021. Cowes Police Station  Shortly before 5pm on Sunday 25 December 1949, witness Jones, observed three men loading a safe onto a trailer outside the Continental Guest House. Jones discovered it to be burglarly and rang the local police.   There he wakened First Constable Hodgson, reported the matter to him and arranged to pick him up by car. Hodgson did not wait to dress but simply put a loaded pistol into his dressing gown pocket, and reported the matter to D24.   He then went with Jones to the bridge running between Phillip Island and San Remo, which provided the only road access to the island.   The lack of dust on the approach road, which was under repair, suggested to Hodgson that no other vehicle had passed that way so he called in at the San Remo Post Office and rang D24 with further details of the burglary.  He sent Jones back to pick up his clothes while he stood guard on the bridge in his pyjamas and dressing gown. While he was awaiting Jones's return, the three offenders, who had spent the intervening period making twelve unsuccessful attempts to blow open the safe, came speeding towards the bridge.  Despite the risk, Hodgson stepped onto the middle of the roadway at the entrance to the bridge and waved to the car to stop. The driver accelerated towards him so Hodgson fired two shots at the roadway in front of it before diving to the roadside to avoid being run over. As the car sped past him Hodgson fired further shots, one of which struck the driver's side door. The car skidded wildly as its driver fought for control, then lurched to a stop half off the roadway.   Hodgson then held the men at gunpoint until other police arrived, and they were taken into custody",,131,13,20,

To date, three homes have been raided under the auspices of Operation WIPEOUT resulting in the seizure of large quantities of cash and a variety of illicit drugs. A total of five offenders have been processed with two of the five still incarcerated. As recently as yesterday, members from Knox Police swooped on a residential premises in Knoxfield arresting a 34 year old female and a 40 year old male. A large cache of illicit drugs were seized during the raid including approximately 170 Ecstasy tablets, 90 LSD tabs, one pound of Cannabis, one ounce of Crystal Methyl-amphetamine and smaller amounts of Cocaine and Magic Mushrooms. Investigators also seized in excess of $50,000 cash from the address believed to be the proceeds of drug trafficking and will allege the occupants were running what could ostensibly be described as a commercial drug trafficking enterprise from the address. An extensive surveillance network protected the property. Sergeant McGIBBONY from Knox Police says Operation ‘WIPEOUT’ has been conceptualised with the express purpose of stamping out illicit drug trafficking within the Knox PSA. This type of crime has a flow on effect in terms of both violent and volume crime and we want to assure the public we take an extremely dim view on this behaviour and will do all within our power to combat it. To the general public, if you are aware of persons engaging in illicit drug trafficking we implore you to contact us here at Knox or alternatively via crime stoppers on 1800 333 000.
