Here in QLD we have a couple of tracks and there are plenty of track days and test and tunes to let all the mischief out. Of course hooning still exists but it is mostly immature fuck heads who complain about having to spend $60 to do it legally. Honestly if someone can't afford $60 to do it legally then they should reconsider their hobby. Driving on public roads is a PRIVILEDGE not a right like so many people don't seem to be able to understand. The government and councils don't owe you shit and it's not their responsibility to provide car enthusiasts with facilities. There are tracks for said activities and inline with the above statement of it being a priviledge to be on the roads, not a right, the tracks are usually owned and operated by private companies who charge money for the priviledge. Also $10 wouldn't cover jack shit for an event, there is a lot more to an event than what many of the narrow minded, immature people who perform said hooning activity could ever fathom. This is also the reason why people and property get damaged at these events. In conclusion if you think that the government or councils owe you a track for $10 an event you are delusional and hopefully these bylaws change opinions and put an end to these self important bigots who think the world owes them everything and can't take responsibility for their own actions.",,English,Male,Negative

Police actions fining cyclists over trivia can only ever be counterproductive. I mentioned the Netherlands. The government there not only won't fine cyclists for trivia, but doesn't encourage helmets let alone legislate them for the simple reason they discourage cycling and this loses more lives than it saves!

My grandfather went missing for nearly 24 hours after leaving his daughter's house one night after dinner and we didn't find him until 5pm the next day. He'd had a brain haemhorrage that made him forget how to get home and after doing a 500km round trip we found him approx 30km away from where he should have been. Was a horrible experience and my thoughts are with his family xx,,English,,Negative

If they again fail to show, another ‚Äúbench warrant‚Äù will be issued and this time they may not get bail and will be held until the matter is heard.

Also you can't legally drive a car older than 10 years unless it's considered a classic car and meets compliance with the countries regulations. Also their roads are much better maintained than ours and most people on the autobahn tend to do about 130 which is the limit in central Australia anyway. While I do agree our speed limits are too slow, I also agree that our drivers are too stupid for faster speeds. Better testing, bigger speeds, more cost to VicRoads, more cost to our rego to recoup their costs... No thanks. Honestly I'd rather pay what I'm paying for my rego than be able to do 20km/h higher on the freeway and save a whole 15 minutes off any journey",,English,Male,Positive

So I'm going to give you one, because this could've easily been me and my family in this situation, as I have kids that are the exact same age as this family.  Did you even read Maxines comment? I'm guessing you dont have kids? Or if you do, you've never let them out of your sight, even at night, even in your own house, even when they're asleep?   How about the driver? What kind of piece of shit person hits a baby and drives off?!?! That is worse than any parent not watching their kids... ever. But if you'd read what Maxine has explained, the parents were trying to unpack their car (something any parent does, whenever they take their kids out?!).

And the select few that pick and choose when they come and cause havoc.  I myself have been a scooter rider there for 6-7 years and out of all my experience there, the trouble makers and ‚Äúbogan‚Äù ones are always the kids that come when they are trying to cause trouble. It‚Äôs hard for parents to see that there are a lot of us that mind our own business because we would rather not be put under the same label as them. But unfortunately most parents see it once and call it quits. Just hope you see that there are a lot of us that go out of our way to help the new, younger generation to grow and love what they do.

People see a Road Guy pulling a Wheelie and go into Cop mode. A wheelie from a person who can control and balance his bike is alot safer than half the riders/drivers on the road! Let alone all the Pitbikes tearing around the Streets. And we're are the Police hhhhhmmmmm  oh Sorry Sir we can't chase  or catch them so put up with it untill another kid does righto pffftt....I'm not endorsing this behaviour.

Every family who has a missing loved one reacts differently, the pain and anguish you live with every single day is like a nightmare you never wake up from. Your head is filled with thousands of unanswered questions, you are constantly questioning yourself and others, there is absolutely no end to the constant pain you go through as there seems no end in sight of any answers, some days you lose all hope as it doesn't seem like you are ever going to find your missing loved one, you have a constant ache in your chest, the stress and strain can take a massive toll on your health, your marriage, your friendships, your mental health, your trust of other people diminishes rapidly, you are constantly scanning the people around you wondering if they know something, ANYTHING to find your loved one, there is never a healing process as you have no body to bury so every day it is a battle.... This is just a slight insight into what a family member goes through every day with a missing loved one. No one has a right to judge what a family does unless they have gone thrpugh exactly what this family have gone through.... I should know, my family have been waiting 45 years to have my sister come home, I have watch my dad pass away through a broken heart, my brother buries his head in the sand as he struggles to cope with the loss of my sister and my mum struggles each and every day not knowing what happened to her girl.

The accident on Princes Freeway near Pt Cook this morning caused absolute mayhem.  Children from Pt Cook could not access roads to get to school. People with appointments in Melb could not get there.  Something has to be done about road closures for such a length of time after a fatality.  I realise  the coroner has to be notified and get there.  With helicopters this should not be an issue but delaying thousands of commuters is an issue.
