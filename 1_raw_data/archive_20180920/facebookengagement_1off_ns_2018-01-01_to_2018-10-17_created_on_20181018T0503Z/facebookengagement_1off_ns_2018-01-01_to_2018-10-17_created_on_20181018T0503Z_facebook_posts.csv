A. Parents and carers should be advised that children under 15 years of age are at the greatest risk of harm from drinking and that for this age group, not drinking alcohol is especially important. B. For young people aged 15−17 years, the safest option is to delay the initiation of drinking for as long as possible. Put simply, it is best for young people aged under 18 years to avoid drinking alcohol. It is also important to understand that young adults aged up to 25 years are also still at greater risk of alcohol-related harms.

Greater Dandenong licensing Inspector Mark Langhorn said some of the benefits of being a Liquor Accord member include an agreement to a standard of responsible management for the licensed premises, community recognition for commitment and a clearly articulated link between the accord and overall community safety strategies.     “It is vital to the success of a Liquor Accord that we have a good representative group to discuss issues that impact the liquor industry,” he said.    “I commend licensees to the Greater Dandenong Liquor Accord which will provide the platform to network with other key stakeholders.”    The next Liquor Accord meeting is set for 3pm on Tuesday, 6 March, 2018.     Expressions of interest to become a member of the Greater Dandenong Liquor Accord can be emailed to Sgt Green at greater-dandenong-li@police.vic.gov.au",,,7,1,2,

Thieves have targeted schools, community sporting clubs, residential and commercial properties.  The meters are stolen by thieves for their value as brass scrap metal and sold on the black market. Each meter is worth only between $15 and $40, but cost South East Water up to $1,000 for replacement. These thefts cause the residents huge inconvenience as often their property has the water shut off for days and they are not able to shower, use the toilet or cook. They are also required to foot the bill for the plumber to install the new meter. Commercial businesses can potentially suffer huge losses if machines are forced to shut down until water is reconnected and schools.  These meters are easily stolen by desperate thieves and only require unbolting with a shifter. The issue for the thieves is offloading them as reputable scrap metal dealers want touch accept them and provide details to police of anyone attempting to sell them to the police.   Police are urging residents to be vigilant and keep an eye out for any suspicious activity especially late at night or the early hours of the morning when most of the thefts are occurring.  Images and video  are attached of a thief who ripped off and stole a length of copper water pipe from St Francis Xavier Catholic Church on Davey Street Frankston, at 1 AM on 14/01/18.",,,30,51,21,

As there was no answer the male has then jumped the side fence and forced entry into the property via one of the rear windows.   The eagle-eyed resident has notified her partner and whilst she kept the property under observations, he has rallied together the neighborhood to approach the address, whilst 000 was called.   The male offender has jumped back out the back window and began scaling rear fences whilst being chased by the large group of Woodlea residents. Other residents of Woodlea have observed what was happening and joined forces to successfully conduct a citizen arrest on the male.

Easy. Will he see you later or in a while?   A quick note to say farewell, as tomorrow I start a new role as a Detective in a neighbouring division.   I started my police career in Wyndham as a brand new trainee five years ago. I've had the pleasure of working with the most dedicated, resilient police officers this state will likely see. I've met so many wonderful people of Wyndham, been afforded so many opportunities, learnt more than I ever thought possible and I'll admit, I've had some days I'd rather forget. However this picture comes from a shift I'll always hold dear: I had the pleasure of working one of my final shifts on the divvy van with my father, Superintendent Gillard (who hasn't worked a div van since police used typewriters... long before I was born.)  Being an admin of this page has been so enjoyable, and I thank each and every follower for their support, curiosity and engagement. Without the followers, there's no point in having the page. When you see your police officers out and about, please say hi. You're the reason they do what they do, and rest assured, whether you see it or not, they continually go above and beyond for the people of Wyndham.

This offending justifiably upset segments of our Kyabram community.  One of the lads was from Bendigo and had 10 other warrants outstanding plus the new charges for the offences that occurred in Kyabram over the previous week.   He was remanded into custody at Bendigo Police Station.  The other 14 year old was from Kyabram and he was charged for all the offences in Kyabram committed in the company or the Bendigo lad.  The Kyabram youth was presented before a bail justice and bailed into his mother care to appear Bendigo Magistrates' Court the following day.  He failed to appear and was arrested again that day and this time remanded into custody.  The Kyabram lad was originally arrested with the help of a local Kyabram man who observed the two youths rummaging through a vehicle.  The observant community member held the youth and called police.  The vehicles entered were all unlocked with money and other items on display.  These vehicles are considered soft targets.  This is another simple way the community can get involved by removing valuables from their parked cars and locking them.  The 14 year old Kyabram boy was supposed to reside with his mother however he was left largely unsupervised and required to fend for himself.  His offending was stealing cash and credit cards to buy food is linked to the absence of care from his guardian.  Police have since worked closely with DHHS to ensure this issue is addressed for the sake of the youth and also the community.  Local police encourage the local community to vigilant but not alarmed.  Look after your neighbours and if you see something suspicious please let us know.

The driver of the white van at the back failed to notice that the vehicles ahead had stopped due to traffic congestion on approach to the roundabout, and shoved all five vehicles ahead of him into one another. Two drivers were taken to Frankston Hospital with minor injuries, whilst five vehicles were extensively damaged and one received minor damage. The 48 y.o. male from Donvale who was driving the van received a $238 fine with 1 demerit point attached for failing to drive a sufficient distance behind a vehicle.    Both Frankston and the Mornington Peninsula Council areas have numerous roundabouts which regularly have traffic build-up on their approaches - especially in the am/pm peaks.

When the lights turned green a blue Holden station wagon directly in front of them accelerated away to a detected speed of 131 km/h. The vehicle was intercepted, and the members spoke to the 31 y.o. female driver from Frankston South, who had an 8 y.o. girl in the front passenger seat.  The driver held a P2 probationary driver licence (0.00 alcohol limit) but wasn't carrying it with her, and there were no 'P' plates displayed on the car. She then underwent a preliminary breath test which detected alcohol, and a subsequent test showed an alleged reading of 0.054%. The driver stated that she had been drinking bourbon whilst driving, only moments prior to being intercepted.  The vehicle was then impounded for a minimum of 30 days with a release fee of $1042.40. Prior to the tow-truck arriving the driver wrote a note in the dust on the bonnet of the car, presumably for her partner who owns the car to read when he gets it out of the impound yard. (See circled)  The female will be receiving a summons to appear in Frankston Magistrates' Court for; Exceeding Speed Limit, Drink Driving, Consuming Intoxicating Liquor Whilst Driving, Failing to Carry Probationary Licence & Failing to Display 'P' Plates.   If you are speeding with alcohol/drugs in your system and have a collision which seriously injures or kills someone then you will possibly be facing a period of imprisonment, irrespective of your prior driving history. Please slow down and don't drink (or drug) drive.  (Author: VP30339)",,,217,298,77,

Another crime trend is emerging.  Since 1 February, 2018 there have been a number of incidents across Wyndham where tradesmen's / women's utes have been broken into and power tools have been stolen.  The majority of vehicles have been parked on the street however some were also parked in driveways.  The vehicles are dual cab utes and trays with the tools being secured by tonneau cover (fibreglass and canvas) and in the case of trays, metal tool boxes secured with padlocks.  In most cases the offender/s use an unknown tool, most likely a jemmy or similar, to force open the locks, handles or windows of the utes.  Each theft has seen a significant amount of tools stolen from each vehicle.  The thefts occur mainly overnight with no specific areas or time identified.  There has been a total lack of eyewitnesses and no description of the offender/s or vehicle/s.  Opinion: -  Only utes containing tools have been broken into with no other property, such as wallets or mobile phones have been stolen -  The large area covered across Wyndham and the quantity of tools stolen suggests that offender/s are using a vehicle/s to commit these offences -  Due to a lack of eyewitnesses, it is highly likely the offences are being committed in the early morning hours when there are less people around.  Opportunities: -  Tradesmen / women to secure the tools by ensuring their utes and tool boxes are always locked, using good quality padlocks -  If available, park your ute in a secure garage -  Keep serial numbers of your power tools that will assist police recover the items if they are stolen -  Contact police by dialling 000 if you see any person/s breaking into utes or acting suspiciously in close proximity to a tradesman's / woman's ute.  That's all Eyewatchers.  Until next time.",,,64,64,53,

The male was slashing blueberry bushes on the property when he hit a tree stump and the tractor rolled. The tractor had no rollover protection and the driver was fortunate to not receive more serious injuries. As can be seen in the attached photos there was a multi-agency response involving police, CFA and the ambulance service.  Off-road collisions are a reasonably common occurrence in the Frankston & Mornington Peninsula areas, given our semi-rural location. Police receive regular reports of private property motorbike accidents etc, however we have also been seeing increased amounts of incidents such as people not engaging handbrakes correctly in steep driveways and being crushed by their cars.  The message is to always maintain your concentration when in/around vehicles, either on or off road. Don't relax just because you're at home or somewhere else ""off-road"". The vehicle doesn't care where it is, and serious / life threatening injuries can be sustained anywhere.  (VP30339)",,,24,4,4,

Suitable police members have been selected to attend the Victoria Police Bike Patrol (Mountain Bike) Course.  Once qualified, these police members will supplement the existing qualified local members who will be tasked to patrol the city of Knox on mountain bikes on selected dates.    Bike Patrol units carry full operational equipment including Capsicum foam, extendable batons, handcuffs and firearms.  They can even conduct preliminary breath tests.  Bike Patrol Units will be used for proactive patrols and will be using full search and arrest powers just like any other operational police unit.  They key difference is that Bike Patrols can quickly and quietly get into places that divisional vans can’t with additional support from other local police being quickly and readily available via the police radio if needed (Dog Squad and Airwing included).  It is expected that deployment of the Bike Patrol Units will lead to an increase in arrests - particularly in relation to outstanding warrants and other persons wanted by police.  Expect to see the Knox Bike Patrol units popping up in a park, a shopping centre or any other public place near you.  Don’t be a stranger, make sure you say hello!

Police spoke to the male driver who was unable to provide any identification.  Police were not satisfied with the name that he had provided to them.   Police searched the driver and located a small quantity of methyl amphetamine (ice) and a knife in his possession.  The suspect was then conveyed back to the Knox Police Station where police used facial recognition technology, known as ‘IFace’ to quickly uncover the suspects true identity.    Police allege that the accused is a 31 year old man formerly of a Belgrave address.  Police then established that the accused was wanted by numerous different police investigators for various offences across the eastern suburbs.    Several of our dedicated and hardworking Detectives were then woken at 3am and called in to investigate further.    The accused was subsequently interviewed at length by police before being formally charged and remanded in custody this afternoon during an out of sessions court hearing at the Knox Police Station.  The charges include: Breach of bail, Commit indictable offence whilst on bail, Aggravated carjacking, Assault with weapon, Theft of motor vehicle, theft (x2), Handle stolen goods (x10), Possess drug of dependence (x2), Dealing with proceeds of crime (x3), Possess controlled weapon and state false name & address.    Police are also investigating the use of stolen ID’s and credit cards.  Numerous further charges are expected to follow which are likely to include theft and deception related offences.  Victoria Police IFace technology allows police to photograph suspects and compare images taken to over a million images held on the police database.  In this case, Police identified the accused within seconds of his image being taken.

Good morning,   Yesterday the Crime Statistics Agency released the quarterly crime statistics, which identify Victoria has seen the biggest percentage drop in crime since the early 1990’s  Locally there has been a large volume of work undertaken by your Police to reduce crime in the Greater Shepparton area.  This has been achieved though the ongoing support of our partner agencies and you the community.  A notable decrease of Assault and related offences with Family Violence related assaults appearing to plateau.  This can be attributed to the strong focus and increased commitment to address the impact of Family Violence within our Community with the assistance of our partner agencies.  Further the recent announcement of additional dedicated resources to target Family Violence will complement our already strong commitment and dedication to tackling Family Violence within our community.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the community for their ongoing support of their local Police who continue to do some great work.  This is evident through the increased detection of drug cultivation & manufacturing which is a combination of great policing and community assistance in the supplying of information which is often the small piece required to enable Police to take relevant action.  I strongly encourage you as the community to continue to provide this information as it is integral in supporting us to reduce the harm within your community.

Accounts that have ""Gumtree User"" as the users name - instead of a persons name - usually a fake account.   2. Gumtree or similiar accounts that have no mobile phone number attached to the buyer - usually only emailed questions.   3. Buyer accounts that are ""Fresh"" - IE: ""Has been a member since March 2018"" - usually a fake account. Look for users that have held accounts for years.   4. Requests to ""Meet up"" in surburban streets to inspect the phone. (Not cool) If you're wanting to meet away from your residential address - go to where CCTV is available. Should something go wrong - we have a solid avenue of enquiry 👮‍♂️  5. If meeting a potential buyer - take friends with you. Dont go alone and dont meet at night (Not cool) 🤫  6. Demand you be SMS'd on an ETA to the meeting location - if this doesnt occur, the buyer isnt wanting you to know their mobile phone number - meh 🙄  Your safety/well being is paramount.

BEFUDDLED is a drink / drug driving operation targeting back roads and vehicles leaving licensed premises. Over the weekend Somerville HWP members working BEFUDDLED conducted 1267 alcohol PBT's & 15 POFT's for drugs. 5 drivers were found to be over the limit and a total of 4 vehicles were impounded for drink driving / driving whilst disqualified offences. On Saturday a driver failed to stop at a PBT site and tried to hide his car in a local car wash. He was processed in relation to unlicensed/ drink driving (0.100%) and evading police. He will appear at court at a later date and faces a lengthy disqualification period. The driver will also need to explain to his wife why her car was impounded for a period of 30 days. His reason for driving? ""To buy 2 litres of milk"".  On Sunday evening a driver was stopped at a PBT site in McCrae and when requested to accompany police to a breath testing vehicle he grabbed a can of Melbourne Bitter and sculled it. He then gave police some novel ideas about where they could put their Breath Testing machine. As he attempted to drink another can of Melbourne Bitter he was arrested for drunk and lodged at Rosebud Police Station. He was later charged & bailed for to failing to remain for a breath test, resist police and drunk. His licence was suspended and he will appear at Dromana Magistrates Court at a later date.   OIC of Somerville HWP Acting Senior Sergeant Peter Martin said “There are still some drivers out there making very poor choices. There has been a lot of publicity in the last week about how many police will be supporting operations such as BEFUDDLED and NEXUS, so it shouldn’t come as any surprise to these idiots that they find themselves staring down the straw of a PBT device. I’m grateful that the local police members took them off the roads before they injured or killed someone.”",,,19,1,4,

A 20 y.o. P plater from Chelsea had his black Toyota Supra impounded last night (see attached photo) after being observed doing a burnout at the intersection of Springvale Rd / Waterways Bvd in Aspendale Gardens. He will be receiving a summons to appear at court re Improper Use of a Motor Vehicle.   At about 1.30am on Wednesday 28th March the Peninsula Link Control Room advised the HWP nightshift unit that a vehicle was travelling South at approximately 150 km/h. A short time later the HWP unit observed a blue Holden ute travelling at extremely high speed past Golf Links Rd. Police then went after the vehicle and attempted an intercept with lights and siren, at which time the vehicle accelerated to an even higher speed. Police then  disengaged due to safety concerns, with the ute last checked speeding away at 201 km/h. Follow-up enquiries led police to a Mornington address, where the vehicle was impounded the following evening. A 28 y.o. Mornington man was also arrested and will face court at a later date for charges including reckless conduct endangering life, travelling at a dangerous speed and failing to stop when directed to do so by police.  Drivers who have their cars impounded lose them for a minimum of 30 days, and have to pay a fee of approximately $1000 to have them released. This is separate to any additional penalties that may be imposed on them at court.  Why not avoid the grief? Just do the right thing and you get to keep your car, keep your money and keep the roads safe.",,,60,30,11,

Our Community Safety Team were patrolling Pacific Werribee as a part of their daily tasking when they spotted a youth acting suspicious around a couple of unattended bicycles. A 15yo Werribee youth decided he needed one of the bikes more than the actual owner and took it upon himself to relieve the owner of their bike. The CST members had a quick foot pursuit with the youth, and luckily for us and the victim, some of our fittest were on hand to chase him and the bike down. The bike has since been returned to its rightful owner and the youth has been interviewed and received an official Police Caution (entitled to receive a caution due to having no prior police involvement). We strongly encourage you to make sure all of your property is secured to make it difficult for people to releive you of it.",,,26,2,5,

The shed was remote from the farm house and the most disturbing items stolen included three firearms.    While the longarms were stored in a metal cabinet that met the minimum requirements of legislation;  they were not stored in a specialised firearm safe.  The shed contain tools and powertools, some of which were used in the burglary.    I have included a story I posted back in 2016 on this topic of firearm storage.  I urge all firearm owners to consider the suggestions.    Hot topic – Review  your Firearm Security  Firearm safety does not end with the handling of a gun.  As a responsible registered firearm owner you do not want to see your firearms in the wrong hands.  It is not just the loss of a valuable asset; imagine learning your stolen firearm has been used in an illegal activity, often many years after the theft. Firearm owners need to consider the quality of their firearm storage cabinet.   The average collection of three modern quality firearms could be valued at over $3000.   My question; do you want to secure your valuable firearms in a cabinet that meets the MINIMUM requirement?     Why not exceed the minimum, especially when a quality firearm safe may be worth only $300 to $500.  The security, and peace of mind, is invaluable.   Now consider where you LOCATE your safe/cabinet.    Is your firearm safe in a shed on the farm?  While this will not breach any storage requirement; it is not the best location!  A shed or workshop may store tools that could assist a thief breaking into your firearm cabinet.  A farm shed remote from the house also has less foot traffic and low natural surveillance, often providing a thief with more time and opportunity to gain access to your firearms.  Often guns stolen from this type of  environment are missing for a week before the theft is noticed.    It is recommend that you secure the cabinet in a residential environment, such as the house or the garage and not in remote sheds, workshops or a holiday house.    Let us consider the worst case scenario, your guns are stolen.  An effective last line of defense could be a cabinet door activated electronic alarm and gun trigger lock.  The locks will stop them being used until some significant engineering work is completed.   Cabinet door alarms are simple and inexpensive.    My final recommendation is to establish security habits with handling and storage of your firearms.  Now that you have the security - USE IT.  Store you ammunition separately.    Use your locks and alarms.  Store your keys appropriately.  After a good day, take the time to remove firearms from your vehicle and store away appropriately.

After a bus ride to Melbourne Sgt ROBINSON and the children explored the circuit, watched some qualifying laps and enjoyed some of the off track entertainment. Many of the children were very impressed with the Roulette's flying display which flew overhead and the children picked out a car that they thought Sgt ROBINSON would look good driving around in, a $500,000 McLaren 570GT.   Sgt ROBINSON and the children met some of the Grand Prix promo workers who were kind enough to pose for a photo.   Lunch was eaten track side before we all loaded back onto the bus and headed home, we didn’t realise at this time that the bus ride home was going to be the most exciting part of the day.   After heading through Bacchus Marsh, a number of warning alarms activated on the bus and we were stuck, broken down on the side of the highway.  The bus company sorted us out quite quickly and everyone was returned home to Ballarat safely.  Sgt ROBINSON is currently in the process of engaging with the Ballarat Specialist School, who have classes attending the Farm Campus next to the Ballarat North Police Station, with the plan of commencing a program where Police interact regularly with special needs kids at the farm.   It is hoped that this interaction will break down some barriers for the children and encourage them to approach Police for help in the future if they require it.  Special needs children are often intimidated by Police and this program aims to show these children that Police are just regular people doing a job and that job is to help people in need.    Ballarat North Police members have made a number of presentations to school groups at the Farm Campus and Gillies Street campus, which have been very well received so far.

Shortly before 2am yesterday morning members attempted to intercept a motorbike in Brunel Rd Seaford, because it had blue tape altering the number plate. The rider wasn't keen to speak police and sped off, reaching 148 km/h in the 60 zone. This seemed to be too much for his bike, as the chain then came off and began sparking on the road, at which time he rolled to a stop and then fell off. Police then finally got to speak to the uninjured 29 y.o. male rider from Seaford and found that he was already disqualified from riding/driving. He then also tested positive for methylamphetamine.   The bike was impounded for a minimum of 30 days, and during the inspection police found a switch had been installed to turn off the number plate light, which he did whilst evading interception.  The male stated he was heading to work at his nearby factory. Sometime in the near future he will be heading to the Frankston Magistrates' Court  where he will be answering a summons for charges including Driving Whilst Disqualified, Evading Police, Drug Driving, Altering Number Plates, Using an Unsafe Motor Vehicle & Speed Dangerous.

Large quantities are involved - up to 2000 litres of deisel and 1000 litres of chemicals.  These thefts required access, time and  significant pumping, transportation and planning.    Be on the look out for trucks with tanks moving around rural areas at unusual times. Farms do not get deliveries at 2am in the morning!  Please take a note of  registrations, times and locations.

Police had a chat with the male driver and quickly establish his licence is suspended.    He had been to Court three times recently for the same reason; driving with his licence suspended.  Over his driving history his licence had been disqualified 11 times and he has been caught driving unlicensed a total of 23 times!  So back to court he goes for driving while suspended and add to that driving a unregistered vehicle.  It was apparent that the only thing that upset him was having his vehicle impounded.  Hopefully by the time he purchases his next vehicle he will have a valid licence?  Or his vehicle will be impounded…again.  There is an easier and safer way.,,,50,33,14,

The weather is getting cooler and some fog has been rolling in, seriously decreasing visibility on our roads and creating dangerous conditions. How many cars came towards you out of the fog this morning without their headlights on? Hard to see weren't they?   It's common sense to put your headlights on in such conditions, and apart from that, it's also the law.  Road Rule 215.1.a states; ""A driver must not drive at night, or in hazardous weather conditions causing reduced visibility unless  the headlights, tail lights and number plate light fitted to the driver's vehicle are operating effectively and are clearly visible.""  Remember the law (and common sense) says HEADlights, not parking lights. Parking lights are for parking, not for use when driving.    The penalty if intercepted committing this offence is a $238 fine and 1 demerit point.  The penalty if someone pulls out in front of you because they couldn't see you in the fog without your headlights on could be much worse.       (Author: VP30339)",,,59,11,49,

These issues relate to anti-social behaviour and low level criminal offending in this area and as a result a police operation is now running to address this behaviour.  Over recent weeks police have been receiving intelligence reports from the community and collating 000 calls so that patrols and response can be target to the area in peak periods.  Public will see an increased presence of both marked and unmarked police and vehicles etc. in the area who will be tasked to concentrate on street crime and offences.

Police then observed this vehicle slowly reversing away from the scene, with the driver clearly struggling to control the car. They then approached the vehicle at which time the female driver argued about doing a preliminary breath test before blowing way over.  In her car she had a small whiskey glass with orange and vodka with ice in the centre console, whilst in the passenger side foot well she had a half full bottle of orange juice and vodka. She then argued about coming back to the station, after which she took two attempts to blow through the machine and allegedly provide a reading of 0.242%.  The 40 y.o. female driver from Seaford was already disqualified from driving and had multiple prior convictions for drink driving and refusing breath tests. She was then locked up for drunk and her car was impounded for a minimum of 30 days.  Many thanks to the drivers who brought this to the attention of police at the scene.

The offenders have been cutting cyclone fences and forcing doors or cutting the lock on these shipping containers. Items stolen include high end machinery and tools including compressors, copper piping, a motor cycle and golf equipment.  Most incidents are being carried out by groups of two or more due to the extent of property stolen at each incident with offenders most likely to continue to target shipping containers due to the high value of property stored and limited security measures in place.

Wyndham Police would like to remind the community to consider these tips when you are out and about in public and using public transport -   If possible, try to keep anything of value hidden from view and ensure you utilise a sturdy lock when leaving your bicycle at a shopping centre/train station.  Stay aware of your surroundings and if possible walk on the footpath facing oncoming traffic.  Be alert in and around public transport hubs including bus stops and train stations.  There has been some thefts recently of mobile phones and bicycles in the Point Cook and Williams Landing transport areas.  Be observant, and if anyone appears suspicious or tries to distract you - keep a safe distance.  Never hand over your mobile phone if someone asks you to 'borrow it to make a phone call'.  If possible, do not walk around at night time by yourself.  Ensure that you have at least one ear free at all times when using headphones.  If you need emergency assistance or wish to report any suspicious behaviour call Triple Zero (000) or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.  Wyndham Police are actively patrolling your local area and conducting specific operations to ensure your safety, but there will be times that we are not in the 'right place at the right time' and need your help to ensure you, your family and friends stay safe.  #workingtogether",,,32,18,23,

The AirWing patrol just like any other Police unit to deter, detect and apprehend offenders.  Caroline Springs and Melton Police Members get a lot of community enquires regarding the AirWing being overhead in the area. On many occasions the AirWing is pro-actively Patrolling the Caroline Springs and Melton area as part of our activities to prevent crime.   Some recent examples of the great work done by the AirWing to support your local Melton and Caroline Springs police units have been:  In the early hours of the 3rd May 2018 Airwing observed a stolen vehicle driving around Brookfield, with the occupants trying to break into cars. The AirWing alerted ground units and directed patrol units to the location of the stolen vehicle allowing Police units to move in and safely arrest four offenders.  On Saturday the 14th April 2018 Airwing observed a stolen vehicle concealed and abandoned in local parkland. Without their ability to see into the area Police on the ground would not have been able to locate it. The vehicle was retrieved and returned to its owner.  On the 4th March 2018 while Airwing were patrolling they located a vehicle involved in a Police ramming. The Airwing followed the vehicle and directed police units to it as the offenders travelled along the road unaware. The Airwing provided great information that allowed the local Sergeant to organise a planned and coordinated response, resulting in the safe intercept of the vehicle and arrest of the offenders.   The Airwing is a great resource to have and members of the community can be assured that their presence in the skies overhead is an important service that helps your local police operate safely and effectively to address crime.",,,206,50,33,

This operation will still continue for some time but we still need the community to continue to make 000 calls with regards to this behaviour when it’s happening.    These 000 calls will not only enable police to collate times and locations where this behaviour is occurring to better target patrols but will also enable police attendance and involvement.

This only encourages thieves.   - Ensure your car is left locked, that includes windows and doors. - Don't hide spare keys in the car. - At night, park your car in a garage or private driveway.

Money, handbags and electronics such as phones are attractive to thieves. Follow some simple advice to help protect you from thefts:  - Be confident, know where you're going and keep your eyes up - Walk purposefully, be aware of your surroundings, taking notice of street names etc. - At night, keep to well lit streets and avoid dark areas. Don't take short cuts through dark, deserted places. Walking in pairs or in a group is a good idea too. - Complain loudly if you are harassed and consider carrying a personal alarm - Always keep one ear free when using headphones - Keep handbags zipped up and never leave them unattended  - Place money , purses and wallets away immediately after a transaction - Keep valuables such as phones and other electronics hidden away when not in use.

Recently, we have had a number of serious injury collisions involving road cyclists around Frankston & the Mornington Peninsula; * 5th March Pt. Nepean Rd Sorrento: Cyclist rides into back of parked car. Sustains serious facial injuries and is taken to hospital. * 20th April Pt. Nepean Rd Rosebud; 90 y.o. pedestrian walks out in front of cyclist - both taken to hospital. * 21st April Nepean Hwy Frankston: Cyclist at speed down Oliver's Hill ran into a car which failed to give way whilst turning into the boat ramp entry road (not the first time this has occurred here). Cyclist taken to hospital with possible broken ribs. * 9th May Dundas St Rye: Cyclist at speed around Melbourne Rd roundabout hit by car not expecting cyclist to turn. Taken to hospital with possible internal injuries. * 12th May Nepean Hwy / Old Moorooduc Rd Dromana: Two road cyclists at speed collided when one failed to see the other whilst turning. Both riders taken to hospital, one with serious facial injuries.    We have many popular cycling routes throughout Frankston & the Mornington Peninsula, and these cyclists are sometimes travelling at speed.

There are a number of inquires being undertaken as it was done in quite a public area. If anyone has information as to the possible identity of the offenders please contact crime stoppers on 1800333000.  And here in an excerpt from excellent article on why stealing phones is pointless...  What you should do if your Apple iPhone gets stolen By Max Eddy -ZNews   Apple deserves some credit for creating consumer electronics that excite people so much that they're willing to camp out days and weeks just to buy them. It also means that people are more than willing to steal them, and if that happens you might lose a lot more than just a phone. You could easily lose your identity, your personal data, your money, and the trust of your friends. What to do if you've already lost your iPhone Let's start with the worst-case scenario: You've already lost your iPhone and you haven't secured your device with a passcode or set up Find My iPhone — Apple's excellent anti-theft tool. Unfortunately, once the phone is out of your hands there's precious little you can do to help get it back. Without any protection on your phone, the most important task is mitigating the damage to you. Deactivate the phone with your network provider to prevent the thief from running up a lot of charges on your bill. Some providers will deactivate your device on their network, which prevents a thief from just resetting the device and slapping in a new SIM card. Note that once you deactivate service, you won't be able to communicate with your iPhone via Find My iPhone. But again, this scenario assumes that's not an option....

Stolen number plates can create a great deal of inconvenience to the consumer. There is a fee involved in replacing lost, stolen or damaged number plates in Victoria so it makes sense to minimise the risk of them being stolen.  Members of the public can obtain one way anti theft screws from any of the police stations within the City of Whittlesea in order to make stealing them more difficult for thieves.",,,4,2,0,

Over the past 4 weeks there have been 5 Residential Burglary and 14 TFMV offences occur in the Ocean Grove area. Nearly all of these offences have been during night time hours, with the burglaries occurring on residential premises, houses under construction and holiday homes and TFMVs occurring in the streets, driveways and carports of residential premises. The offences have included:  An increase in burglaries on Houses Under Construction/Renovation where power and hand tools have been stolen; o Although the offences initially appeared to be random in nature, the increase in Theft From Motor Vehicles where tools are also being stolen leads to the conclusion that the incidents are highly likely targeted.  It is recommend that Tradies ensure their work utilities and trailers are properly secured (locked) of an evening  and that preferably they are parked in garages or behind closed gates.  A senor flood light in the driveway where the vehicle is parked is a great deterrent to anybody loitering around.   Houses under construction should be secured correctly every evening and tradesmen should delay installing electrical house fittings like dishwashers, instant gas hot water systems, stoves and air conditioning units till just before handover of the property if possible.  The community are urge to dial 000 if they see any person(s) or vehicles hanging around the area and acting suspiciously.  Police would prefer to receive these calls immediately so that they can investigate at the time rather than subsequently.  If you have any information regarding the commission of these offences after the fact you are requested to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.  This can been done anonymously.

About the program: The Brimbank Youth Connect Program brings together young people through a common passion around sport and provides them with an opportunity to connect with their community and build their self-esteem.  Using a local hip hop star as a drawcard, we commenced the program with a forum to better understand issues facing young people and how police can help. We heard from youth about what they loved about their community, what they thought the issues facing their community were and what police can do better.  We often talk about tackling and preventing youth crime, but we rarely engage young people to be part of the conversation or solution.  More than 20 young people from CALD backgrounds shared their thoughts and ideas about policing, perceptions of safety and how the community can work better with police.  Following these discussions, we heard the young people wanted to be part of sport so we decided to host a basketball tournament at the Police Academy to teach and encourage sportsmanship and teamwork.  Police see an opportunity to ensure young people are engaged through what they are most interested and provide them with a safe space to do this.  Having positive relationships with young people is important to Victoria Police as it helps us establish trust, break down barriers and build strong relationships.  We recognise the importance of positive engagement with young people and that having a sense of purpose and prosocial networks can reduce engagement in criminal activity, which ultimately benefits the entire community.  This program is an initiative undertaken in partnership between Victoria Police, and the Multicultural Affairs and Social Cohesion Division of the Victorian Government’s Department of Premier and Cabinet.  The project aims to co-design and deliver initiatives that promote harmony and cultural understanding in local communities whilst building trust and confidence in Victoria Police.  This partnership approach ensures that issues impacting culturally and linguistically diverse communities (CALD) are identified through direct engagement with the community.  2. How many youths attended the tournament? More than 14 young people from the western suburbs attended the basketball tournament at the Police Academy on Saturday 12 May.  Participants were given the opportunity to represent their community in a supportive team environment.  The basketball teams integrated a mixture of young people and police in a friendly and competitive tournament.  The tournament encouraged inclusion, sportsmanship and teamwork, and it was great to see all the participates personal competitive drive whilst still supporting one another.  The winning team were awarded a trophy, which is currently been proudly displayed at the local secondary college.  All participants received an engraved medal and other players were excited to receive a new basketball and a certificate for winning a number of awards, including the ‘Blueys Award’ for displaying fair and generous behaviour consistently throughout the game.  The tournament included a shared BBQ lunch, with food from a number of different cultures.  3. What activities went on? We also gave the young people a tour of the Police Academy before starting the basketball tournament. Everyone really enjoyed this, and were excited to be given rare behind-the-scenes access to the facilities.  During the tour, youth were shown the mock court, police station, a scenario village and the chapel and parade ground, where recruits graduate.  4. What's next? Following the success of this program, a number of participants have volunteered to be a part of a new Brimbank Youth Group, which police will work with to plan future activities.  Brimbank Police are also currently in consultation with a local high school to explore holding regular basketball tournaments after school.  There will also be another tournament in the future to see if the trophy can be taken from Saturday’s winning team.  5. How was it received? The youth were inspired to see the Police Academy, with many of them saying it was one of their highlights.  They enjoyed the basketball tournament, played competitively but kept the intended spirit of the day at the forefront.  Everyone had a great day getting to know one another and the tournament broke down some of the barriers between police and young people, giving police an opportunity to make strong and positive impressions on them for life.",,,31,2,5,

Members from Cardinia Highway Patrol detected a worrying amount of people exceeding the speed limit at a dangerous level in their shift yesterday afternoon.  The first, a 23 year old driver from Nar Nar Goon, was detected traveling at 114km/h in a 100 zone on the Princes Freeway, Pakenham.  On the Princes Freeway, Nar Nar Goon police detected another 5 drivers exceeding the speed limit with a a 19 year old probationary driver from Trafalgar detected traveling at 125km/h in the 100 zone.

Every speed has a consequence and all drivers in these instances were issued with infringement notices.  Please pay attention to the speed zones - studies show that small increases in speed can have large increases in the level of injury or the likelihood of death. Equally though, small decreases in speed can significantly reduce the severity of injuries to the vulnerable human, or avoid the crash in the first place.  vp40485",,,51,43,13,

Quite often I see posts by community members on this page, as well as locally supported social media pages, expressing concerns when they hear and/or see the police helicopter (otherwise known as POLAIR) in the skies over Wyndham. On occasion, police stations receive phone calls asking the same question.  Over recent times, POLAIR has proven to be an invaluable resource in addition to more traditional policing methods. They assist with a range of events both planned and unplanned.  There are substantial costs involved in maintaining and operating such a sophisticated machine however money is no object when it comes to our commitment to ensuring safety and service delivery in YOUR community. I personally as a supervisor, as well as my colleagues, often call on assistance from airborne resources without any thought other than to ensure maximum safety for our personnel and the community. By being able to have eyes observing from above we are able to identify and mitigate potential risks during an incident as well achieving our overall objective as safely and efficiently as possible.  Next time you see or hear POLAIR above please do not be alarmed, but rather feel confident that we are armed with the necessary tools to maximise our service delivery.

The first incident occurred in Cressy between 31-May-2018 and the 01-Jun-2018 with approximately 12 Industrial sized batteries were stolen.  The 2nd incident was the mobile tower exchange building in Buckley which was entered on the same night as Cressy. Offenders have stolen 16 batteries each weighing 65kg each.  Lastly between 05-May-2018 06-May-2018 offenders have attended the Mobile Base Station on McCurdy Road Fyansford. Offenders have stolen 6 sets of 4 batteries 24 batteries in total.  The main function of these batteries is to provide power to the cell tower or exchange in the event of a power outage, with the capacity to keep telecommunication sites running for several hours without mains electrical power. This Police Division alone has approximately 228 of these particular towers.    The batteries that are being stolen are similar in appearance to 12V car batteries but are larger in size and have a higher output capacity. These batteries can be run down and then recharged a number of times due to the high amounts of Lithium. They come in numerous brands and sizes. They can weigh up to 80kg.  We seek the assistance of the public to supply information in relation to these thefts.  It is highly likely that there is more than one offender involved in these thefts and offender/s will probably be using a larger style vehicle with the offences occurring in isolated areas predominately.  If you see a larger style vehicle in the vicinity of one of these mobile towers or anyone acting suspiciously in the vicinity you are requested to dial 000 immediately.

Elder abuse is any act which causes harm to an older person and is carried out by someone they know and trust such as a family member or friend. The abuse may be physical, social, financial, psychological or sexual and can include mistreatment and neglect.  In many parts of the world elder abuse occurs with little recognition or response. It is a global social issue which affects the health, well-being, independence and human rights of millions of older people around the world, and an issue which deserves the attention of all in the community.  Individuals, communities, municipalities and organisations will come together across the globe to hold events on 15 June that raise awareness of elder abuse. Senior Rights Victoria encourages organisations to celebrate the positive contributions of older people in our communities.  “Older people are essential in the fabric of our society. It’s time for us to acknowledge their importance and recognise they are entitled to the respect of their communities and especially their families,” Seniors Rights Victoria Manager Jenny Blakey said.  What can help improve the safety of someone at risk? • Ensuring older people are social connected is an important way to reduce an older persons vulnerability to abuse.  • Victims of elder abuse are sometimes socially isolated with a reliance on a carer, who may be their abuser. Keeping in contact with older friends and family and ensuring they are access with a trusted person to speak to is another way to reduce older people’s vulnerability to abuse.  • In-home services can also play an important role in monitoring and supporting someone at risk of elder abuse.

The Police and Clinician Emergency Response (PACER) unit is a partnership between Ballarat Police and Ballarat Health Services, and involves mental health clinicians teaming up with police to provide prompt and specialist care for people who need mental health support in the community.  The PACER unit has already been successfully implemented in many divisions across the state with positive results.  ""Ballarat police is pleased to have a PACER unit at the station, where police can request the unit when responding to any situation where someone requires mental health treatment,” Inspector Davison said.  PACER allows police and clinicians to work collaboratively to assess and treat people in a timely manner wherever they are in the community, including in their own home. The unit links community members with the most appropriate support services that best meets their needs.  The collaborative approach will also reduce the need for police to transport people to emergency departments, where they can face lengthy wait times.",,,71,23,5,

Buying things online is a great way to save a few bucks. Here are some things to consider when purchasing a mobile phone from a private seller.  If purchasing a second-hand mobile phone, this can be risky as the item may have been reported lost or stolen.  Request from the seller the phones IMEI number so you can check its status before purchasing at www.lost.amta.org.au.   It only provides details of phones reported lost or stolen at the time of the inquiry. There can be a 72-hour lag between when a mobile is reported lost and stolen to the carrier and showing “blocked” on the website. If looking to purchase a phone via a Facebook Marketplace, all interactions are generally conducted through Facebook messenger or via comments people leave on items when they appear in the buy / swap / sell groups.  If possible, consider trying to obtain a contact phone number from the seller so more detailed communication can be entered into about the item.  Occasionally things don’t quite go to plan when parties meet to exchange cash for an item of interest.  Instances have occurred where victims’ have had their cash stolen, their own mobile phone stolen, or even been physically assaulted during the course of the meeting.  Obtaining information from the seller such as their real name (as some people do create Facebook profiles under a pseudonym), a contact number or email address prior to arranging to meet can assist the police with avenues of inquiry if the transaction doesn’t quite go to plan.  1. Trust your instincts. 2. Don't go alone, have a friend accompany you to the agreed meeting place. 3. Insist to meet at a public place. 4. Do not meet in a secluded area. 5. Do not invite strangers into your home, and do not go into theirs. 6. Be cautious when buying/selling high value items. 7. Do the transaction during daylight hours. 8. If it sounds too good to be true, it normally is. 9. Tell a friend or family member about your plan to meet & make a purchase. 10. Always have your own phone with you. 11. Bring only the agreed-upon cash. 12. Don’t give out too much of your own personal information. 13.

The people involved were fortunate to avoid serious injury. In almost all cases, the vehicles involved were rendered undrivable and had to be towed from the scene. Some vehicles will be able to be repaired whilst others will most likely be written off.   A number of penalty notices have been issued for a range of offences including: ‘Fail to give way/stop’; ‘Follow too close to the vehicle in front’ and failing to obey traffic control signals. Penalties range from $238 to $396 and incur up to three demerit points.  Many of the collisions could have been avoided if drivers were concentrating on the task of driving and obeying all the relevant signs, lights, road markings and traffic conditions.  In one incident that occurred on Mt Dandenong Rd on Tuesday afternoon, a vehicle that failed to give way to oncoming traffic collided with another vehicle causing it to overturn. Fortunately, everyone involved escaped serious injury. Several lanes of the road were closed causing significant traffic disruption and both vehicles were written off.  Even minor collisions can attract significant penalties and much inconvenience with vehicle repairs, processing insurance claims and time without a means of transport.

Acting Sergeant Mark Thomas said he hopes that people will take up this opportunity to come down and speak to police about community issues in a neutral and informal space.  “The aim of this initiative is to create a community where people feel safe and connected. “We want to encourage everyone join us for a coffee and discuss issues which are important to them. “We are here to provide advice about crime prevention, local issues and any concerns in our community.” “Building a positive relationship with the Waurn Ponds community is a high priority for us and we hope to see many of you there this Wednesday.”  Community members are invited to join Waurn Ponds Police at the Waurn Ponds Shopping Centre at Mrs FIELDS on Wednesday 4th July at 10am.",,,40,10,9,

Held at multiple locations in Wyndham including the Wyndham North Police Station, the six-week program was designed to equip aspiring young leaders from diverse backgrounds with the communication, leadership and networking skills they need to confidently contribute to their local community.  The program provided the youth, who were identified as having strong networks with community, with practical and theoretical training so they can be a voice for diversity, create a shared sense of cohesion and connect with disengaged youth peers.  “We have youth from culturally diverse backgrounds in our community who understand what cultural exclusion means and they are motivated to use this experience to make their local area an even better place to live. Through this training program, we have developed talented young leaders who can be positive influences to inspire their own communities and create social change,” Sergeant Tim Jacobs said.

Request and record their details, then end call and contact the organisation (in this case Telstra) and ask to be transferred to the operator.  We doubt you will find them.

An elderly victim was recently targeted with the con men knocking on the victims door and asking if they wanted a tree cut down in their backyard. The victim agreed and the con men drove the victim to the bank to withdraw $2500 from the ATM, The incident was reported by the victims son in law  as victim was elderly and suffered from dementia.   Travelling con men are dodgy tradesmen who knock on doors of homes and small businesses, offering to do maintenance work.  They offer to do jobs such as driveway resurfacing, painting, roof repairs and carpet cleaning at a cheap rate. Often, they pressure people, offering 'today only' specials. Travelling con men ask for cash before starting work and frequently disappear as soon as you pay them. If they do any work, it is often unfinished or of a poor standard.  If you suspect a travelling con man is knocking on your door, do not answer. If you do speak to them, ask them to leave. If they refuse, they are breaking the law. Record as much information as you can, such as their name and vehicle registration.      Travelling con men incidents can be reported to the national travelling con men hotline on 1300 133 408 or to your your local police.

RAISING THE ISSUE WITH AN OLDER DRIVER  An older driver may not realise their driving skills are deteriorating. If you are concerned about their driving ability, give them your honest opinion and encourage them to speak to their doctor and to get an independent assessment.  Discuss your concerns early Family members and friends need to have ongoing safety discussions with older drivers, to calmly raise the sensitive issue of the need to think about modifying or stopping driving.   Conversations can be about the following: • How driving conditions have changed, with faster and heavier traffic that makes driving more stressful. • How changes in health can affect safe driving. • Any near misses or minor collisions, or incidents of getting lost while driving. • How self-regulating driving can be more enjoyable. See Vic Roads Helping them stay on the road page (e.g. restricting driving to times of the day and conditions that are less stressful). • Getting to know how to use public transport while the driver can still drive. • Driving expenses (e.g. registration, insurance, fuel, maintenance) and whether these are worth it if the driver is driving infrequently; the savings from not paying these expenses would pay for a lot of taxi trips. • Attending a older driving program or road safety education session. • Having a professional assessment by a reputable driving school or an occupational therapist specialising in driver assessment. • See 2005 American Society on Aging Business and Aging Award for We Need To Talk: Family (External link)  • Ideally, you should start these discussions well before there is a significant problem and the person needs to stop driving. • More information can also be found on Vic Roads Getting around without a car page.  Reporting unsafe drivers • If you have concerns that a driver poses a safety risk, you should notify VicRoads. If reported, that person may be asked to undergo a licence test if medical opinion suggests a test is appropriate. See Vic Roads Reporting a medical condition or driver page for more information.  Helping them stay on the road There may come a time when an older driver will need to reduce or stop driving, but the advice of their doctor and other health professionals is very important in this decision. A responsible driver will also listen carefully if their spouse, relatives or friends show concerns about their driving. With help, an ageing driver will often be able to modify their behaviour and gradually transition from driving to getting around without a car, rather than having to suddenly stop driving altogether.  Dealing with the effects of ageing Ageing can affect men and women differently. On average, women live six years longer than men. There is the very real possibility that, when their spouses die, women may have difficulty getting around. Family and friends of older or impaired drivers can help by encouraging them to: • visit the doctor and optometrist frequently for a check-up (family members could accompany them, to ensure that health and driving are discussed) • watch for changes in physical and mental health that may indicate a problem lies ahead • ensure that all health professionals and pharmacists know that they drive • undertake a driving assessment and if necessary a refresher course, to improve their confidence. Driving with ageing problems or increasing medical impairment Family and friends can help ageing or impaired drivers to think about what they would do if they need to reduce or stop driving.  Suggestions include: • planning ahead – discuss the possibility of suffering from a health condition in the future that makes driving impossible and plan to share the driving with their spouse to get experience and confidence now • discussing alternative transport options with the extended family if both partners are unable to drive • contacting local councils to identify possible alternatives to private transport • considering moving them closer to family or friends or closer to public transport.  Self-regulation To compensate for reduced abilities older drivers generally self-regulate their driving, avoiding times and conditions in which they feel threatened or uncomfortable. However, a driver most at risk, for example, someone suffering from a mental disability, is also the least able to self-regulate. Some form of formal monitoring will also be needed from family and friends.  Sensible self-regulation strategies include:  • avoiding busy roads and peak hour traffic • avoiding glare by not driving at night or into the setting or rising sun • taking extra care when driving from shaded areas into sunlight and vice versa • avoiding driving in bad weather • not driving on days when you are not feeling at your best. If the older driver has not already modified their driving, family and friends could suggest that they try these self-regulation strategies. Family and friends can also help older drivers to try alternative ways of getting around while they are still driving. The older driver could use their car to drive to familiar places or to public transport, where parking is often free. This reduces their car expenses and they will not have to drive on busy, unfamiliar roads.  If the older person is not confident using public transport or a taxi, family and friends can help by taking the trip with them to help them gain confidence. Family and friends could drive the person to locations that may pose a challenge to an older driver. The older person may be able to offer something in return for this, such as making dinner, child minding or paying for petrol.  Road safety education sessions and programs for older drivers An older driver may benefit from attending a road safety education session or a driving program.  Sometimes free education sessions are advertised in the local press. Get contact details for community road safety education sessions on the Considering your driving future page.  Considering your driving future Find ways to improve and consider your driving choices. The information and checklists will encourage you to think about your driving and assist you to understand your legal obligations in relation to driving, Victoria’s licensing system and what is involved in having a driver assessment.  The safe driving checklist and workbook The questions in this checklist show possible problems and it’s important that you become aware and monitor them. Safe driving checklist in The Victorian Older Drivers' Handbook [PDF 75 Kb] There are several ways in which you might wish to use the checklist.  • read through yourself and spend some time thinking about the possible problems, or fill out the checklist and see how well you do.  • ask someone like your spouse or a regular passenger who travels with you to fill out the checklist and discuss the answers with you. • If you answered 'Yes' to six or more questions, you should speak to your doctor about whether or not it is safe to continue driving. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medical conditions or medicines may affect your driving. • You may also like to work through The Enhanced Driving Decisions Workbook (External link). After answering questions, feedback is provided on various concerns and what they mean for driving. Driving assessment • In some cases it might be a good idea to have your driving ability professionally assessed by a driving instructor or an occupational therapist who specialises in driver assessment.  Older driver programs There are programs that can help improve an older driver’s skills and confidence. The RACV Drive School Seniors Program provides professional advice about driving ability. It offers practical tuition and solutions to assist in maintaining mobility, as well as providing an honest assessment of driving.  Alternatively, you can attend a road safety education session. These courses provide road law updates, give people the chance to ask questions, and provide useful information about medical conditions, medicines and safe driving. You can contact the organisations below to enquire about the next session in your area and to book your place. You can also arrange to hold one of these seminars for your own community group.  • RACV Years Ahead program (External link) • TAC Community Mobility Program (External link)  • your local municipal council (External link) may also offer road safety sessions You may also want to visit the safe driving tips page.  Making the right decision In Victoria people can drive to any age as long as it is safe for them to do so. It is often the driver who decides to reduce or stop driving, perhaps because driving is becoming difficult or stressful, or because of advice from a doctor, family member or friend. You should plan early for when you may no longer want to, or be able to, drive. Otherwise there is a risk that this decision may be taken out of your hands due to a fitness to drive assessment. When people are suddenly confronted with the likelihood that it is no longer safe for them to drive, it often comes as a great shock. A person whose licence is suddenly taken away can often experience feelings of isolation and depression, which may compound other health problems. It can also lead to a greater dependence on others, such as family members and friends, which in turn can impose unwanted pressures on relationships. It is a good idea to start thinking about what you could do to get around if you need to (or decide to) reduce or stop driving, well before this becomes necessary. It is also important to understand the possible consequences of driving when you are unfit to drive. Aside from posing a possible safety risk to yourself and others, if you are in a crash your car insurance company may refuse to pay the claim. Think about where you live and how this will affect you if you become unable to drive. Would it be helpful to move closer to family and friends, public transport, shops and hospitals? Talk to your family and friends about how they could help you, learn to use public transport while you are still driving, and find out about other services that may help you to stay mobile or connected.",,,11,6,15,

Those vehicles requiring checks were then intercepted further down the road by HWP members.  In 6 hours, police detected;  * 7 suspended drivers * 1 drug driver * 29 unregistered vehicles * 2 unlicensed drivers * 1 speeding driver * 1 unroadworthy vehicle  This operation will be run regularly on local roads, and is designed to create high visibility policing and reduce road trauma.  Unauthorised drivers and unregistered vehicles are over represented in road trauma statistics. Four people have lost their lives on our local roads in 2018, and 81 have received serious injuries.   Acting Senior Sergeant Pete MARTIN, Officer in Charge of Somerville Highway Patrol, expressed concern with the actions of some drivers travelling on Peninsula Link during this operation.    A/S/Sgt Martin said, ""New laws requiring motorists to slow down when passing emergency vehicles with the lights operating have been in place for over a year.  Yesterday I was horrified at the speed that some motorists drove at when passing police members who were standing on the roadside.  The next time the operation is run there will be police cars dedicated to enforcing these laws and educating motorists.""  The current penalty notice fine for failing to slow to 40 km/h when passing an emergency vehicle with lights operating is $282 but more importantly failing to slow down is putting police and other emergency workers in danger.

The CIU, led by Detective Senior Constable McCann, has worked hard over the past eight months to identify offenders and hold them to account.   In December 2017 police executed a number of warrants in Melton West. A 34-year-old man was arrested and charged with 16 burglaries, nine attempted burglaries, 11 counts of theft and a further three charges of theft of motor vehicle.   The man was sentenced in June for an imprisonment period of 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.   As the investigation continued, further warrants were executed in Melton West in January, which resulted in a 36-year-old man being arrested and charged with 11 burglaries, five attempted burglaries, four thefts of motor vehicle, eight thefts, 14 counts of committing offences on bail, unlawful possession and going equipped to steal.  Last month the man was sentenced to 22 months of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months.   Months of hard work by Melton police and assistance from the community has resulted in two offenders being held in custody for crimes that caused a great deal of disruption to the everyday workings of many local businesses.

Various power tools including chain saws continue to be stolen in significant numbers, at a significant cost.  From 1st June to 16th July 2018 specific trends in relation to the theft of tools in the Division have been identified.  Over the above period a total of 91 stolen items were categorised as power tools, stolen from 44 recorded incidents of burglary, theft from vehicles, retail shop theft and other thefts.  A breakdown of the property types indicates that cordless drills & other drills (18), angle grinder (8), circular saw (8) and chain saw (7) make up the top group of property which also contains various other power tool types.    Popular quality brands are also likely the most prevalent, Makita (20) Ryobi (9), Milwaukee (9), Stihl (5), AEG (5), Hitachi (4), Bosch (2), Honda (2) and Dewalt (2).   Protecting Your Tools  Lock Them Up  A lot of tool theft is done on an opportunistic basis. This means that offenders are driving around looking for random targets. By leaving your tools unsecured you are giving them the opportunity to steal. If offenders walk up to your ute and see that your equipment is well secured, they are more likely to go looking somewhere else which provides an easier opportunity. As a minimum, all toolboxes should be properly secured to the tray of your ute and they should also have big solid locks on the lids or doors. Also consider the hinges, as weak hinges on some toolboxes can easily be broken.  Any large equipment that cannot fit in a toolbox should be locked to your vehicle with a chain and padlock. Ladders should be secured in a similar way, or even taken off the ute and placed inside your home if possible. Most average padlocks can be easily and quietly cut using bolt cutters, and other types of toolbox locks can often be jemmied open with a crowbar, so don’t skimp on your security devices or quality of tool box.  Keep Them Out Of Sight  Most tool thefts occur from utes parked outside of a residential home during the evening. The easiest way to stop this happening is to park your ute or trailer inside your garage or shed. If you already have two cars in the garage, or if your garage doubles as storage space for the rest of your gear it may not be possible to park inside. In this case at least consider parking off the street. If you have room down the side of your house this can be a good option. A movement sensor light installed above this space though will also act as a good deterrent.  ID Your Equipment  Despite your best efforts, there is nothing you can do that will 100% guarantee the safety of our tools. So if they are going to get stolen, we want to make sure that we have the best chance of recovering them. All of your valuable tools should be engraved with your driver’s licence number.  By using your licence number and including the State (e.g. V for Victoria – V123456789) at the start police will be able to quickly find you in their system and will have your current address details on file. . This may not stop someone from stealing them, but it will make them harder to sell and easier to identify if the police locate a large quantity of tools in the possession of an offender.  It is also a good idea to keep a comprehensive record of each and every tool, from your most expensive power tools through to every little drill bit and screwdriver. Although initially is a long process it will make reporting to police and insurance companies an easier process.  Include make, model number and serial numbers.  Essentially there are four main tips to protect your tools. • Lock them up • Keep them out of sight • ID your equipment and tools • Keep them properly insured Your tools are a big part of your ability to earn an income as a tradesman, so it is worth making the effort to keep them safe.",,,11,20,28,

One tyre was worn through to the steel belt underneath.  Her vehicle was grounded due to the appalling condition of the tyres that would have affected her vehicle handling and braking performance.   She was also issued with a $403 penalty notice and will have to present her vehicle to VicRoads in order to clear the defect notice.  Police would like to remind all motorists to conduct regular checks to ensure that their vehicle tyres are safe and have sufficient tread depth.   During winter, the weather is often poor and a worn tyre can severely compromise vehicle braking and handling in wet conditions.  A check of the vehicle lights (headlights, brake lights, tail lights, etc) should also be conducted regularly. A blown headlight can significantly reduce your seeing distance and visibility to other vehicles at night or in poor weather.  Don’t risk a fine and avoid a trip to VicRoads by doing a few simple vehicle checks.",,,15,2,0,

Often people are concerned about the noise or damage to the environment, and sometimes the riders are reported as endangering the safety of others. A tragic example of what can happen as a result of this illegal behaviour occurred at the Carrum Downs Shopping Centre in September 2015.   Given the places these bikes can access that police vehicles can’t, and the tendency of the riders not to obey police directions to stop and thereby create more dangerous situations, the issue is a difficult one to police. Despite this, Somerville HWP and local police remain committed to dealing with this issue as best we can, and welcome public assistance to do so.

We’re pleased to say that generally good behaviour was observed.   Police conducted over 50 visits to licensed premises, catching three drink drivers and issuing nine penalty notices for driving offences whilst leaving licensed premises and surrounding areas.   Police also conducted wider patrols in the community, targeting people breaking into and stealing cars or committing burglaries. We arrested 31 offenders for various crime and drug-related offences and will be put before the courts.   With a recent increase of police officers arriving and working in the area, future ongoing operations are planned to target the offences of most concern to our local community.   We want to thank the community for assisting us in reducing opportunistic crimes.

The vehicle accelerated away and was checked at approximately 150 km/h in an 80 zone on Ballarto Rd before it decided to pull over.   The police members observed recent accident damage to the Territory, and an enquiry over the police radio confirmed it had been involved in a nearby hit-run collision a short time before. The vehicle ID was then checked and it was found to have been stolen from Warragul two weeks earlier. The 19 y.o. female driver from Frankston and 30 y.o. male passenger from Cranbourne were then arrested and conveyed back to the Frankston Police Station.   The female was searched and approximately 1.6g of ""Ice"" was allegedly located on her person. She was remanded in custody and appeared at Melbourne Magistrates' Court later that day for charges including Theft of Motor Vehicle, Unlicensed Driving, Drug Driving, Speed Dangerous, Drug Possession and False Number Plates. She was given a 12 month Community Corrections Order which included 250 hrs of Community Work, a $1000 fine and a 2 year ban from driving. Her male passenger was released pending summons.

You may end up hurting yourselves, someone else or get arrested – it’s simply not worth it.  “Be mindful of noise, respectful to neighbours and the community, look out for your mate and don’t be afraid to call out your friends if they’re taking things too far.  “Like every year, we will be working with our partner agencies to make sure everyone has a safe well-earned break.”  No official schoolies events are planned for the Mornington Peninsula area this year.

Police moved off to intercept the Territory, which continued North at high speed onto the Frankston Freeway. Police activated lights and sirens whilst catching up to the vehicle, and observed it starting to blow smoke whilst exiting at Thames Promenade. Police then intercepted the vehicle near Wells Rd, where it had nearly come to a halt with a blown engine.   The vehicle was being driven by a 39 y.o. male from Carrum Downs, with two 16 y.o. male passengers. The driver told police that he was on his way to basketball, and when asked why he was speeding said ""I was just showing off."" The driver was then found to be unlicensed and returned a positive drug test. The vehicle was unregistered, and was impounded due to the excessive speed.   The driver was then arrested for reckless conduct and outstanding arrest warrants, and was conveyed back to the Frankston Police Station for processing. He was subsequently bailed with strict conditions to appear at the Frankston Magistrates' Court at a later date for charges including Reckless Conduct Endangering Life, Speed/Manner Dangerous, Unlicensed Driving, Unregistered & Drug Driving.

The Somerville HWP Police Nightshift unit was patrolling in Mornington at about 2am this morning when the officers saw a vehicle driving with false number plates attached. It was then intercepted, and police spoke to the 44 y.o. male driver from Mornington, who allegedly ""smelt like a brewery"". The driver admitted not having a licence since losing it back in 2011 for a previous drink driving conviction, and a check on the vehicle showed that it was unregistered.   The driver was then taken back to the Mornington Police Station where he was breath tested and blew 0.176%. He was also drug tested which returned a positive result for MDMA (Ecstasy) & Methylamphetamine (""Ice"").   The driver's car was then impounded and towed away, but not before he kicked dents into virtually every side panel of his defenceless blue Honda Civic. He was then collected by a ""none too happy"" wife, and will appear in court in due course.  This was one of three drug-drivers that the unit picked up during their shift. The others were a 38 y.o. male from Mt. Martha who was intercepted near Mornington Racecourse at 1am, and a 40 y.o. male from Endeavour Hills who was intercepted on Thompsons Rd near Western Port Hwy at 11pm.   Drug drivers were involved in 42 collisions in the Frankston & Mornington Peninsula areas in 2017. One of those was a fatality, and 16 resulted in serious injuries. If you drive on drugs, you really are out of your mind.    (VP30339)",,,29,21,5,

Some important issues were raised that we wish to share with the broader community.  ·       Why were no arrests made? We understand this incident was very confronting for the residents affected by this behaviour and generally the need to make arrests is an important part of law enforcement. However the nature of the incident made identity of actual offenders difficult for police to determine at the time and would slow our response down considerably. The priority for the police was the safety of residents and the preservation of the peace. Determination of which person in the group threw rocks could come later but we wanted to protect our community.  ·       Why did the Public Order Response Team go in with equipment on? Rocks had been thrown and for the members’ safety it was thought appropriate.  ·       Why was the Air Wing present? We have the Air Wing there to record from overhead the behaviour of the youths and feedback to the supervisors on the ground. They also provided us with some excellent footage of the people involved which might assist later.  ·       Why did police tell people to go back inside their houses? This occurred at the time we were about to take steps to disperse the youths. It was about ensuring everyone was safe in moving around the area. We also didn’t want arguments between residents and the youths slowing the dispersal process.  ·       What are police doing about this going forward? We have continued to task patrols to the area. Local police have been out and about on foot and in marked and unmarked vehicles, supported by specialist resources including the Mounted Branch whose presence will continue in coming nights.  ·       We have supported the investigation team’s enquiries by assisting with a door knock, providing a letter drop to residents and communicating to people through Crime Stoppers and Eyewatch.  ·       Our Taskforce Wayward detectives are working hard on the investigation – compiling evidence, speaking to witnesses and building a picture of what happened so we can hold those responsible to account for their behaviour.   ·       Police have engaged with the school principals network to speak with students to discourage further involvement in this type of behaviour, establish a point of contact with Victoria Police and to assist any persons involved.   ·       We have met with Melton City Council and the Taylors Hill Safety Group – which comprises police, community members, as well as local, state and federal government stakeholders – to discuss what happened and how we work together to prevent it from happening in future.  ·       Police will continue to work closely with community stakeholders and groups that manage youths and will do our best to ensure this does not occur again.  Finally, we want to reassure you – the community – that your safety is our priority. We have a standing response plan in place and are well-resourced and prepared to respond to any issues that may arise.  If anyone witnessed the incident on Wednesday night or has any information which may assist police in their investigation, please contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.

A few of the key changes are summarised below:   1. Windows tinting  Provided that at least a side rear vision mirror is fitted to each side of a vehicle, the minimum visible light transmittance (VLT) for windows located behind the driver changes to:  • 0% for vehicles primarily designed for the carriage of goods, or • 20% for all other light vehicles  2. Additional headlights  Additional headlights will no longer have to be fitted in pairs to permit the fitment of LED light bars. Up to 4 additional headlights will be allowed to be fitted to a vehicle, provided that they are fitted in a way so that they are facing forward and symmetrical in relation to the vehicle’s centre line.  3. Fitting brake lights  To retain the design value of vintage and historical vehicles manufactured before 1 January 1973, a light fitted to a vehicle that has dual functions as a brake light and a direction indicator light will be treated as a brake light.  The change does not apply to vehicles manufactured after 1 January 1973. Find out more about the changes here:  http://bit.ly/vehiclestandardsVR",,,8,2,12,

Somerville HWP Police first observed their red Holden Commodore just after 11pm last night, speeding along Frankston Gardens Dr away from an area where a large amount of tyre smoke was hanging in the air. When pulled over, the car's bald tyres stank of burning rubber, and the 24 y.o. male driver from Langwarrin was issued with 3 tickets (totalling $1128) and his car was defected for numerous faults.   Then, just after midnight (about an hour later), the same vehicle was seen deliberately losing traction on Colemans Rd Carrum Downs and doing a burnout. Somerville HWP police then intercepted the vehicle for a 2nd time, finding a 23 y.o. male from Keysborough driving and the owner now sitting in the passenger seat. The Commodore was then impounded and towed away for a minimum of a month (release fee $961) and the driver will face court at a later date for numerous road policing offences.  The Carrum Downs Industrial Estate has long been an area subject to complaints about hoon behaviour, and it is regularly patrolled by local police and HWP units.

Detectives have spoken to a range of people as part of the investigation, including two persons of interest, a female assault victim, families, schools, residents and community leaders.   Investigators have identified a number of other matters contributing to what occurred in Taylors Hill and these have been incorporated into what has become a complex investigation.   Whilst the investigation continues, we have interviewed two persons of interest regarding their involvement and expect arrests over coming days.

This operation utilises an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) vehicle to scan passing vehicles. As a result of this operation, Somerville HWP were successful in removing from the roads: 3 Suspended drivers, 2 Disqualified drivers, 10 Unregistered vehicles, 1 Drug driver & 1 False Number Plates. Of those, 2 of the cars were impounded and towed away for 30 days due to the drivers having prior convictions for the same offence.    As was announced on our Eyewatch pages on July 19, enforcement of vehicles passing station emergency vehicles at dangerous speeds was also undertaken. During the operation, 13 motorists were intercepted and fined $282 for “Overtaking a police vehicle / emergency vehicle with flashing red / blue lights operating at a speed greater than 40 km/h”. One of these incidents involved a MICA Ambulance which had stopped at the side of the road due to a medical emergency with a patient that they were carrying.  Acting Senior Sergeant Peter MARTIN, Unit Commander of Somerville HWP was scathing in his description of these motorists; “Fair warning was given that we’d be enforcing this offence strenuously. My members are continually getting into and out of vehicles at these locations. Many motorists don’t realise just how dangerous it is to be driving past an emergency worker when there is literally half a metre or less between the vehicle and the emergency worker. “A car travelling at 100 km/h travels 28 metres in just one second. Sometimes even the wind rush from a passing car puts emergency workers at risk. The law has been in for well over 12 months but even if it wasn’t a law, it’s just common sense not to endanger someone on the roadside.”  Please drive safely.  (VP30339)",,,70,75,43,

Despite the poor weather conditions, approximately 900 vehicles were scanned by the ANPR and a number of offences detected.  • Two drivers returned positive results for illicit drugs. • One driver was detected driving on a suspended driver licence. Their vehicle was found to be defective and they did not have their headlights on. They will face Court in relation to all matters. • Two vehicles were found to be unregistered. The owners were issued with $806 penalty notices. • Nine defect notices were issued to drivers who came through the site with headlights that were not working. In most instances, vehicles had a single non-operational headlight. Police are reminding drivers that even a single non-functioning headlight greatly reduces your visibility of the road ahead and to other vehicles at night and in poor weather conditions. These drivers will have to effect repairs to their vehicles and present them to VicRoads. • ..and finally; a 20 year old male driver was detected driving on a learner permit without an accompanying full licence holder or L-plates displayed. When questioned, the male stated that he “just wanted to go for a drive”. It turned out to be an expensive night out as he was subsequently issued with penalty notices totalling $967!  Further operations of this kind will be conducted in future to detect unlicenced or impaired drivers and remove defective vehicles from the road.  #roadtozero",,,61,27,6,

On arrival they found a light pole in the centre median strip had been knocked over, which was blocking one Eastbound & one Westbound lane. The car involved had left the scene, leaving behind a number plate which had come off in the collision.  Enquiries then led police to a nearby address where the vehicle and its 20 y.o. (uninjured) male driver were located. The driver said he was making a right turn from Centre Rd into Cranbourne Rd, and lost control after accelerating too heavily on the wet road. He was then taken to the Frankston Police Station for a breath test and allegedly blew 0.144%. His probationary licence was immediately suspended pending being summonsed to court, where he faces a substantial fine and a lengthy loss of licence. His still driveable XR6 Ford Ute was impounded for 30 days with a release fee of $961. He will also need to have an alcohol interlock fitted to ANY vehicle he drives for a minimum of 6 months when he regains his licence.  This young man now has no licence, no car, heavy fines and ran the risk of seriously injuring himself and other people.   Please think before you get behind the wheel.  Are you right to drive?

In many cases the person receiving this invoice has used the business or company for legitimate means and go ahead and make payment without realising it is not the actual business that is being paid.   These invoices arrive via email and people are encouraged to contact the company directly and confirm if these is any outstanding payments due and the amount requested before proceeding any further. An alternative scam is a business who is regularly invoiced by a supplier receives notification that a new account for payment has been created.  We strongly advise the business to contact their supplier and confirm these details prior to payment.     Some useful tips to protect yourself: DON’T respond to offers, deals or requests for your details. Stop and take time to independently check the offer. • DON’T rely on glowing testimonials: find solid evidence from independent sources (not those provided with the offer). • ALWAYS type in the address of a website of a bank, business or authority on the internet rather than opening a link as it’s safer. • ALWAYS look up phone numbers in an independent directory, when you wish to check if a request or offer is genuine. • NEVER click on a link provided in an unsolicited email as it will probably lead to a fake website designed to trap you. • NEVER use phone numbers provided with unsolicited requests or offers as they probably connect you to fakes who will try to trap you with lies. • NEVER respond to out of the blue requests for your personal details. • NEVER send money or give credit card, account or other personal details to anyone who makes unsolicited offers or requests for information.

This driver was travelling at an excessive speed whilst alcohol affected, committing two of the fatal five at the one time = a recipe for disaster.  40485",,,27,6,3,

Some left turning drivers are coming to a halt at the give way sign unnecessarily, causing traffic on Coolart Rd to bank back from the intersection, interrupting traffic flow and increasing the chance of rear-end collisions.   Drivers turning left out of Coolart Rd have a dedicated merging lane which they MUST use when making this left turn. Merging straight out of Coolart Rd into the Westbound lane of Frankston-Flinders Rd across the solid white line is illegal. Left turning vehicles should turn into the merging lane, get up to an appropriate speed and then whilst using their right indicator, merge across the broken line when safe to do, much like the merging lane onto a freeway. Similarly, the onus is on the merging vehicle crossing the white broken line to give way to Westbound through traffic.   The attached overhead photo from Google Maps shows the correct left turn path marked with the red line. The blue line shows Westbound Frankston-Flinders Rd traffic proceeding past the intersection, initially separated from the merging lane by the solid white line.

The vehicle was found to be unregistered, and the 55 y.o. female driver from Karingal was unlicensed. She was then drug tested and  allegedly went positive to methylamphetamine. Due to having prior convictions for unlicensed driving, her car was impounded for a minimum of 30 days, with a $1005 release fee. She will face Frankston Magistrates' Court at a later date for multiple road policing offences.  The female driver then made a phone call to arrange a ride home, and shortly after a 49 y.o. male also from Karingal drove up. He was then drug tested and, you guessed it, also allegedly went positive to methylamphetamine. He was directed not to drive for a period of 12 hours, and faces a minimum of 6 months licence suspension after confirmation of the drug test result.

Failing to properly restrain items on vehicles, both light and heavy, results in injuries and deaths on our roads. No matter how far the load is being carried it must be properly secured with appropriate equipment such as load rated restraint straps or chains.

They were side by side as they entered Eastlink, then when the 2 lanes merged into one, the dark colored Range Rover has overtaken the Ford ute in the emergency lane before pulling in front of the ute and braked heavily causing the ute to swerve to avoid a collision.

It is important to bring the fatigue risk to the front of everyone’s minds ahead of school holidays , football finals and the country race meetings which involve driving longer distances. We Want people to look ahead and plan their journeys, to allow extra time than what the GPS states, to plan rest periods over long distances particularly when driving at times when they would normally be asleep. The most important message is if you are feeling tired, if you are turning up the radio or winding down the window it is time to pull over and rest.

Theft From Motor Vehicle showed a 34% increase comparative to the previous weekend.  • The majority of the incidents occurred on Saturday night leading into Sunday Morning followed by Sunday night leading into Monday Morning.  • Whittington, St Albans, Newcomb, Geelong CAA, Belmont and Grovedale were targeted. • Grovedale had the overall highest amount of incidents. • 14 incidents occurred in open air car parks. • Small easily transportable items such as handbags, Wallets/Purse, Cash, Computer Tablets and Jewellery.  This offence is opportunistic, so if you remove the opportunity (lock the motor vehicle and remove the valuables from it) the number of offence incidents will decrease. This is a two step process you need to do both.  We all have a rountine of a night that we follow before finally turning out the light. Whatever it is, cup of tea, shower, put the dog out, whatever we need our community to include in their nightly rountine to ensure that they have locked their car and their valuables arent in the vehicle.  This isnt about victim blaming its about reducing the opportunity, its about target hardening and taking responsibility for your own crime prevention.

The first incident occurred on the 12 September when a 21-year-old woman was walking west along the trail near Moss Road just before 7pm. Investigators have been told she was grabbed from behind around the waist before the local woman managed to break free. The man, who was wearing dark clothing, fled in an easterly direction towards Melaluka Road.  Detectives are investigating whether this incident is linked to a similar reported incident on the trail last night (18 September).  Investigators have been told an 18-year-old Leopold woman was riding her bicycle along the trail between Melaluka Road and Kensington Road when she was grabbed by an unknown man just before 11.30pm.  The woman fought off the man, who was armed with a knife, before getting back on her bicycle and riding away, leaving her back pack behind. Police conducted a search of the area but were unable to locate the man. The man was perceived to be Caucasian in appearance, aged in his 40s, with a pale completion, short grey/brown hair and a medium to heavy build.  It’s believed he was wearing a black hooded top and ripped tracksuit pants.  Geelong Superintendent Craig Gillard said Geelong Police took the personal safety of every member of their community very seriously.   “Local detectives along with specialist unit detectives from Melbourne are investigating these reported incidents. “You will see a greater police presence in the area over the coming days. “This will include vehicle patrols, bicycle patrols and police quad bikes throughout the day and night. “I want to assure the residents of Greater Geelong that police are committing all available resources to these investigations with a view to holding those responsible to account,” he said.

To date, three homes have been raided under the auspices of Operation WIPEOUT resulting in the seizure of large quantities of cash and a variety of illicit drugs. A total of five offenders have been processed with two of the five still incarcerated. As recently as yesterday, members from Knox Police swooped on a residential premises in Knoxfield arresting a 34 year old female and a 40 year old male. A large cache of illicit drugs were seized during the raid including approximately 170 Ecstasy tablets, 90 LSD tabs, one pound of Cannabis, one ounce of Crystal Methyl-amphetamine and smaller amounts of Cocaine and Magic Mushrooms. Investigators also seized in excess of $50,000 cash from the address believed to be the proceeds of drug trafficking and will allege the occupants were running what could ostensibly be described as a commercial drug trafficking enterprise from the address. An extensive surveillance network protected the property. Sergeant McGIBBONY from Knox Police says Operation ‘WIPEOUT’ has been conceptualised with the express purpose of stamping out illicit drug trafficking within the Knox PSA. This type of crime has a flow on effect in terms of both violent and volume crime and we want to assure the public we take an extremely dim view on this behaviour and will do all within our power to combat it. To the general public, if you are aware of persons engaging in illicit drug trafficking we implore you to contact us here at Knox or alternatively via crime stoppers on 1800 333 000. To those individuals engaging in this type of behaviour be warned – you are officially on notice.

The driver tested positive to Methylamphetamine, after which she had to walk the children to school.   Suspecting that the message might not have sunk in, the HWP members went to the same location before school yesterday (Wednesday) morning. They saw an occupant exit the house on two occasions and check up and down the street, at which time the police members believe they were spotted. A short time later a taxi arrived.  To check that the ""don't drug drive"" message had hopefully now sunk in, the HWP members swung by the area again this morning (Thursday). A short time after arriving they intercepted the same female driver, who again tested positive for Methylamphetamine.   Current legislation doesn’t allow for immediate suspension of a driver licence / impounding of a vehicle under these circumstances, however it is expected that her licence will be suspended for a minimum of 6 months upon confirmation of the laboratory results.  Somerville HWP has one of the highest drug-driving detection rates in the state. If you are drug driving, it's not a matter of if you'll be detected, it's a matter of when.

The rationale behind the pilot was driven by the Victims Charter Act 2006 and from similar models established in the United Kingdom and New Zealand which demonstrated opportunity for victims of crime to access victim’s services earlier, providing a more timely response to victims of crime and referrals to support services.  With 29 co-locations operating throughout Victoria, Centacare currently operates from 3 stations throughout the Barwon South West region including Colac, Corio and Warrnambool.  Centacare are excited to announce a 4th co-location at the Waurn Ponds police station.  With a more victim centric approach to policing being rolled out in recent years, the approach recognises having victims support services co-located in Police Stations as a vital service response to victims of violent crime against the person. This is further enhanced by the Victoria Police electronic referral (VPeR) system which provides attending police the capacity to refer victims of crime to support services in a timely manner.  The shared aim of this co-location is to provide a high quality, supportive, timely and responsive service to Victims of Violent Crime against the Person by:  ▪ Raising awareness of victim’s services within Victoria Police ▪ Provide timely and seamless access to services available to victims of violent crime ▪ Provide quality services that meet the practical, emotional and psychological needs of victims of crime. ▪ Prepare victims and support them to navigate the criminal justice system and provide referral to specialist victims services i.e. VOCAT, Victims Register, Victim Impact Statements ▪ Link clients to appropriate services in order to support victims in their recovery ▪ Provide assistance and support to Police in dealing with victims of crime. A VAP worker will be available at the Waurn Ponds police station every Tuesday between 9.30 and 4.30 and Friday between 10.30am and 3.30pm (and other times by negotiation).     However outside of these co-location arrangements, referrals to the VAP can be made by telephoning Centacare’s Central Intake Line on 1300 033 818, Monday to Friday from 9:00am -5:00pm OR the Victims of Crime Helpline on 1800 819 817 which operates seven days from 8:00am -11:00pm. ​ Centacare also have offices bases in Geelong and Warrnambool, with outreach available as required. ​  For further information please contact Waurn Ponds Police Station: 5247 3500  PHOTO’S : CENTACARE CEO TONY FITZGERALD, DIVISIONAL SUPERINTENDENT CRAIG GILLARD AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND REGULATION KIRSTEN GEORGE",,,13,2,2,

When we look at the number of offences per 100,000 people, the Wyndham community has achieved the lowest crime rate we have seen in the last 10 years. This is a significant achievement for our vibrant and rapidly-growing community, which we should all be proud of.  The targeted operations we are running to drive down high-volume crime have led to continued reductions in burglaries (20.3 per cent) and theft (6.3 per cent). We have seen a significant increase in reports of sexual offences (33.1 per cent) in our community.  A large portion of this increase is offences relating to child pornography and child sexual exploitation. Our Sexual Offence and Child Abuse Investigation Unit detectives are absolutely committed to apprehending these perpetrators to make our children and broader community safer.  Sexual crimes continue to be one of the most underreported personal crime types, so it is vital we continue to receive these reports so police can support victims and hold offenders to account for these terrible crimes.  Victims of family violence, sexual offences and child abuse can report crime and receive support at the recently-opened Wyndham Multidisciplinary Centre in Werribee.  We also have seen an increase in robberies, with mobile phones being commonly targeted. This is a worrying trend for police which is why we are conducting additional patrols in known hot spots as part of Operation Regnant.  In recent months we have welcomed the first of an additional 12 general duties police officers to the Wyndham Police Service Area who will be deployed by April 2019. These additional officers will further expand our footprint in the community and boost our efforts to keep you safe.  Our focus as we head into the warmer months, will be to deploy resources into areas where we know robberies are likely to occur such as transport hubs, shopping centres and surrounding residential streets and parklands.

The purpose behind this was to address a number of different youth issues prevalent, consisting of truancy, anti -  social behaviour, low level offending, suicide, family violence, homelessness amongst many others.  Since then the program has evolved to a very successful and proven initiative, assisting disengaged youth to reform a connection back with their local community.  It has brought various local community businesses and corporate partners together to assist and understand youth within their community. These include the Education Department, Barwon Health, Ambulance Victoria, Costa Assets, St Laurence, Karingal, Shojun Concreting , Edge Clothing Stores, Mc Donald Real Estate, Bethany, Lions and Rotary groups to name a few.  Many of these young people had adopted a mixture of negative behaviours and had very poor relationships with local police and the wider community.  This was compounded by a lack of positive engagement and direction to guide these young people in their decision-making.  The Victoria Police Geelong Kokoda Youth Program gives teenagers an opportunity to share a life changing experience through positive interaction with role models within our local community.  Some other objectives of the Geelong Kokoda Youth Program are to: Background • Provide a positive and life-changing experience  • Promote re-engagement with school, employment, family and the community • Develop leadership skills to encourage leaders within the community • Break down any existing barriers between young people and police • Reduce offending and anti - social behaviour • Reduce the chances of young people becoming a victim • Promote positive interaction with local businesses and government agencies • Learn the largely untold Kokoda story and appreciate what young Australians did during one of the most important campaigns in our country’s history • Experience the local culture, which is vastly different to our lives in Geelong.  The Geelong Kokoda Youth Program is now in it’s 6th year and so far 59 students, all from local State Secondary Schools have successfully completed this program.  On Friday the 14th of September, 2018 the next group depart from the Geelong Police Station to make the life changing journey to Papua New Guinea to walk the Kokoda Track.

We can ease the stress of using roundabout by using three simple rules: Slow Down: You should always slow to a safe speed when approaching a roundabout. Because of the sudden change in inertia your car goes through when navigating a roundabout, it is much easier to lose control, especially on a wet road. Indicate on approach: If you’re not travelling straight through the roundabout, you will need to indicate left or right to show the drivers around you at what point you intend on leaving the round-about. This allows them to position themselves appropriately. Give way: When approaching a roundabout you will see a give way sign. That means you give way to any cars already present in the round-about.",,,40,54,23,

Frankston & the Mornington Peninsula have recorded six (6) serious injury collisions so far in September, and it would be nice to be held scoreless for the rest of the month.

The stolen credit cards and number plates were then used in further offending including petrol and credit card deceptions.    The arrest of two Shepparton youth on Thursday 27/9/18 is expected to see this offending dip to usual levels ... for now.   What can we all learn from September to improve community safety?   Over half the vehicles entered were unlocked.  Offenders helped themselves to purses, handbags and wallets left in unlocked vehicles.  Under 10% of the vehicles were entered by force.   The community is encouraged to reduce the risk of becoming a vicitim of this type of crime by removing valuables from parked vehicles and locking them; even at home.    Number plate theft; have you secured your plates with one-way screws?  If you visit Shepparton's Autobarn in Wyndham Street - they stock the screws used by Neighbourhood Watch at their Safeplate days.  It works.    Please be like Dave.",,,73,44,36,

We will target speeding on rural roads to reduce road trauma and ensure drivers slow down – Road to Zero.    Will your driving place you, your passengers and other road users at risk?    Research indicates that the risk of death and serious injury increases exponentially with each 1 km/h increase. Safe Speeding?  We have seen the aftermath of road trauma through speeding and do not want our community exposed to this horror.    There is a disproportionate number of people killed on rural roads.  The message ‘speed kills’ is simple;  Increased speed equals an increase in death on our roads. We are all responsible for reducing road trauma. We all need to be mindful of our own driving ability.  Country roads are often not well paved and not well lit.  We all need to drive to the conditions not just under the speed limit.  Remember that the posted speed is the maximum – it doesn’t mean you have to be driving at that speed.  Sunday 30th September was the first Operation RUSH shift and over 10 speeding drivers were caught including one exceeding the limit by over 45km/h.    Slow down!  Reduce road trauma, retain your licence, your money and more importantly your lives.  With Christmas fast approaching, join police by doing everything you can to stop road trauma touching the lives of your family.  Keep safe.  A final reminder - Road Rule 79A:  if you are approaching and passing stationary or slow moving police/emergency service vehicles with flashing red, blue or magenta lights – you must slow down to a safe speed and pass at no more than  40 km/h.  This aims to provide a safer workplace for all emergency service workers.",,,24,8,4,

The warning follows a number of robberies and armed robberies reported to police after several victims had arranged to meet with fake online sellers to pay for and receive goods.  Detectives from Altona North Embona and Wayward Taskforce have recently arrested a man and a teenage boy who, after responding to advertisements for the sale of mobile phones and laptops, committed robberies on the individuals selling the items.   Detectives are also currently investigating a further eight incidents where individuals have been robbed after arranging to meet to sell electrical items.  Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Jennifer LOCKE offers the following advice. “If you are purchasing in person, an item from an online seller, or alternatively, arranging to sell an item, always arrange to meet in a public place, ideally that has the added deterrent of the presence of CCTV camera’s. Consider the vicinity of a police station, or a fast food or shopping complex. Genuine sellers or buyers will be also be happy with this added level of security.”  Buyers should also consider using the following link to confirm whether an IMEI number for a mobile phone has been blocked – an indication that it may be a stolen device http://www.amta.org.au/pages/Lost.and.stolen.phones   The federal government also provides a website which offers proactive advice for people who have been the victim of a scam: http://www.scamwatch.gov.au/   Reports of online scams can also be made to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission via that website.

Unfortunately sales on internet sites such as Gumtree and Facebook have zero buyer accountability and often end poorly.   When listing an item for sale on the internet make some ""Non negotiables""   For example :  - Use eBay or similar where protections are built into the transaction.  - Insist on postage only . . . once payment clears.  - Never attend a location at night. (Daylight hours only)  - If selling a mobile phone or computer, never give your address and always meet at a suitable location with CCTV IE: McDonalds, Police Station Foyer, Service Station  - Always take someone with you - preferably a responsible adult - Never proceed with a sale or a meet up  - if the person wont give you their Mobile Number   - Trust your instinct - if you pull up and sense something not quite right, it probably isn't - leave!   # Some really easy signs of a scam or set up :  1. Offering to pay more then the asking price 2. Wants to buy without looking at the item 3. Meet up location is at night in a residential street 4. Communicates via email only - wont give you a mobile number 5. Mentions overseas 6. Wants to pay with bitcoin, cheque, western union transfer or bottle tops ;)   If in doubt - go to ACCC Scamwatch or call Crimestoppers on 1800 333 000  #soyouknow  http://ow.ly/MYzp30mbKzR  Senior Sergeant Aaron RICHES",,,22,6,12,2
